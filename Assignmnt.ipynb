The configuration of these electrons follows from the principles of quantum mechanics. The number of electrons in each element's electron shells particularly the outermost valence shell is the primary factor in determining its chemical bonding behavior. Hence it is the atomic number alone that determines the chemical properties of an element; and it is for this reason that an element can be defined as consisting of ''any'' mixture of atoms with a given atomic number.\n",

      "878\t\"Santa Claus also known as Saint Nicholas Father Christmas or simply \"\"Santa\"\" is a figure with legendary mythical historical and folkloric origins. The modern figure of Santa Claus was derived from the Dutch figure Sinterklaas which may in turn have its origins in the hagiographical tales concerning the Christian Saint Nicholas. \"\"A Visit from St. Nicholas\"\" also known as \"\"The Night Before Christmas\"\" is a poem first published anonymously in 1823 and generally attributed to Clement Clarke Moore. The poem which has been called \"\"arguably the best-known verses ever written by an American\"\" is largely responsible for the conception of Santa Claus from the mid-nineteenth century to today including his physical appearance the night of his visit his mode of transportation the number and names of his reindeer as well as the tradition that he brings toys to children. The poem has influenced ideas about St. Nicholas and Santa Claus from the United States to the rest of the English-speaking world and beyond. ''Is There a Santa Claus?'' was the title of an editorial appearing in the September 21 1897 edition of The (New York) Sun. The editorial which included the famous reply \"\"Yes Virginia there is a Santa Claus\"\" has become a part of popular Christmas folklore in the United States and Canada.\n",
      "878\t\"The tall tale is a fundamental element of American folk literature. The tall tale's origins are seen in the bragging contests that often occurred when men of the American frontier gathered. A tall tale is a story with unbelievable elements related as if it were true and factual. Some such stories are exaggerations of actual events; others are completely fictional tales set in a familiar setting such as the American Old West or the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. They are usually humorous or good-natured. The line between myth and tall tale is distinguished primarily by age; many myths exaggerate the exploits of their heroes but in tall tales the exaggeration looms large to the extent of becoming the whole of the story.\n",

      "889\t\"A map of south-eastern England showing places visited by Ælle according to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' and the area of modern Sussex.If the dates given by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' are accurate to within half a century then Ælle's reign lies in the middle of the Anglo-Saxon expansion and prior to the final conquest of the Britons. It also seems consistent with the dates given to assume that Ælle's battles predate Mons Badonicus.This in turn would explain the long gap of fifty or more years in the succession of the \"\"bretwaldas\"\": if the peace gained by the Britons did indeed hold till the second half of the 6th century it is not to be expected that an Anglo-Saxon leader should have anything resembling overlordship of England during that time. The idea of a pause in the Anglo-Saxon advance is also supported by the account in Procopius of 6th century migration from Britain to the kingdom of the Franks.  Procopius's account is consistent with what is known to be a contemporary colonization of Armorica (now Brittany in France); the settlers appear to have been at least partly from Dumnonia (modern Cornwall) and the area acquired regions known as Dumnonée and Cornouaille.  It seems likely that something at that time was interrupting the general flow of the Anglo-Saxons from the continent to Britain.\n",

Salieri would recall little from his childhood in later years except passions for sugar reading and music. He twice ran away from home without permission to hear his elder brother play violin concertos in neighboring churches on festival days (resulting in the loss of his beloved sugar) and he recounted being chastised by his father after failing to greet a local priest with proper respect. Salieri responded to the reprimand by saying the priest's organ playing displeased him because it was in an inappropriately theatrical style. Sometime between 1763 and 1764 Salieri suffered the deaths of both parents and was briefly taken in by an anonymous brother a monk in Padua and then for unknown reasons in 1765 or 1766 he became the ward of a Venetian nobleman named Giovanni Mocenigo (which Giovanni is at this time unknown) a member of the powerful and well connected Mocenigo family. It is possible that Antonio's father and Giovanni were friends or business associates but this is obscure. While living in Venice Salieri continued his musical studies with the organist and opera composer Giovanni Battista Pescetti then following Pescetti's sudden death he studied with the opera singer Ferdinando Pacini or Pasini. It was through Pacini that Salieri gained the attention of the composer Florian Leopold Gassmann who impressed with his protege's talents and concerned for the boy's future took the young orphan to Vienna where he personally directed and paid for the remainder of Salieri's musical education.\n",

162,Arsenic,Toxicity and precautions,"

Arsenic and many of its compounds are especially potent poisons.

=== Classification ===

Elemental arsenic and arsenic compounds are classified as ""toxic"" and ""dangerous for the environment"" in the European Union under directive 67/548/EEC.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) recognizes arsenic and arsenic compounds as group 1 carcinogens and the EU lists arsenic trioxide arsenic pentoxide and arsenate salts as category 1 carcinogens.

Arsenic is known to cause arsenicosis when present in drinking water ""the most common species being arsenate ; As(V) and arsenite H3AsO3; As(III)"".

=== Legal limits food and drink ===

In the United States since 2006 the maximum concentration in drinking water allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is 10 ppb and the FDA set the same standard in 2005 for bottled water. The Department of Environmental Protection for New Jersey set a drinking water limit of 5 ppb in 2006. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) value for arsenic metal and inorganic arsenic compounds is 5 mg/m3. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set the permissible exposure limit (PEL) to a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.01 mg/m3 and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set the recommended exposure limit (REL) to a 15-minute constant exposure of 0.002 mg/m3. The PEL for organic arsenic compounds is a TWA of 0.5 mg/m3.

In 2008 based on its ongoing testing of a wide variety of American foods for toxic chemicals the U.S. Food and Drug Administration set the ""level of concern"" for inorganic arsenic apple and pear juices at 23 ppb based on non-carcinogenic effects and began blocking importation of products in excess of this level; it also required recalls for non-conforming domestic products.  In 2011 the national ''Dr. Oz'' television show broadcast a program highlighting tests performed by an independent lab hired by the producers. Though the methodology was disputed (it did not distinguish between organic and inorganic arsenic) the tests showed levels of arsenic up to 36 ppb.  In response FDA tested the worst brand from the ''Dr.'' ''Oz'' show and found much lower levels. Ongoing testing found 95% of the apple juice samples were below the level of concern. Later testing by Consumer Reports showed inorganic arsenic at levels slightly above 10 ppb and the organization urged parents to reduce consumption.  In July 2013 on consideration of consumption by children chronic exposure and carcinogenic effect the FDA established an ""action level"" of 10 ppb for apple juice the same as the drinking water standard.

Concern about arsenic in rice in Bangladesh was raised in 2002 but at the time only Australia had a legal limit for food (one milligram per kilogram).  Concern was raised about people who were eating U.S. rice exceeding WHO standards for personal arsenic intake in 2005.  In 2011 the People's Republic of China set a food standard of 150 ppb for arsenic.

In the United States in 2012 testing by separate groups of researchers at the Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Center at Dartmouth College (early in the year focusing on urinary levels in children) and Consumer Reports (in November) found levels of arsenic in rice that resulted in calls for the FDA to set limits. The FDA released some testing results in September 2012 and as of July 2013 is still collecting data in support of a new potential regulation. It has not recommended any changes in consumer behavior.

Consumer Reports recommended:  
# That the EPA and FDA eliminate arsenic-containing fertilizer drugs and pesticides in food production; 
# That the FDA establish a legal limit for food; 
# That industry change production practices to lower arsenic levels especially in food for children; and 
# That consumers test home water supplies eat a varied diet and cook rice with excess water then draining it off (reducing inorganic arsenic by about one third along with a slight reduction in vitamin content). 
# Evidence-based public health advocates also recommend that given the lack of regulation or labeling for arsenic in the U.S. children should eat no more than 1.5 servings per week of rice and should not drink rice milk as part of their daily diet before age 5.  They also offer recommendations for adults and infants on how to limit arsenic exposure from rice drinking water and fruit juice.
A 2014 World Health Organization advisory conference was scheduled to consider limits of 200–300 ppb for rice.

=== Ecotoxicity ===

Arsenic is bioaccumulative in many organisms marine species in particular but it does not appear to biomagnify significantly in food webs. In polluted areas plant growth may be affected by root uptake of arsenate which is a phosphate analog and therefore readily transported in plant tissues and cells. In polluted areas uptake of the more toxic arsenite ion (found more particularly in reducing conditions) is likely in poorly-drained soils.

=== Biological mechanism ===

Arsenic's toxicity comes from the affinity of arsenic(III) oxides for thiols. Thiols in the form of cysteine residues and cofactors such as lipoic acid and coenzyme A are situated at the active sites of many important enzymes.

Arsenic disrupts ATP production through several mechanisms. At the level of the citric acid cycle arsenic inhibits lipoic acid which is a cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase. By competing with phosphate arsenate uncouples oxidative phosphorylation thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+ mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased which it is speculated has potential to form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. These metabolic interferences lead to death from multi-system organ failure. The organ failure is presumed to be from necrotic cell death not apoptosis since energy reserves have been too depleted for apoptosis to occur.


Although arsenic causes toxicity it can also play a protective role.

=== Exposure risks and remediation ===

Occupational exposure and arsenic poisoning may occur in persons working in industries involving the use of inorganic arsenic and its compounds such as wood preservation glass production nonferrous metal alloys and electronic semiconductor manufacturing. Inorganic arsenic is also found in coke oven emissions associated with the smelter industry.

The conversion between As(III) and As(V) is a large factor in arsenic environmental contamination. According to Croal Gralnick Malasarn and Newman ""the understanding of what stimulates As(III) oxidation and/or limits As(V) reduction is relevant for bioremediation of contaminated sites (Croal). The study of chemolithoautotrophic As(III) oxidizers and the heterotrophic As(V) reducers can help the understanding of the oxidation and/or reduction of arsenic.

=== Treatment ===

Treatment of chronic arsenic poisoning is possible. British anti-lewisite (dimercaprol) is prescribed in doses of 5 mg/kg up to 300 mg every 4 hours for the first day then every 6 hours for the second day and finally every 8 hours for 8 additional days. However the USA's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) states that the long-term effects of arsenic exposure cannot be predicted. Blood urine hair and nails may be tested for arsenic; however these tests cannot foresee possible health outcomes from the exposure. Long-term exposure and consequent excretion through urine has been linked to bladder and kidney cancer in addition to cancer of the liver prostate skin lungs and nasal cavity.

472,Amaranth,Ecology,"
Amaranth weed species have an extended period of germination rapid growth and high rates of seed production and have been causing problems for farmers since the mid-1990s. This is partially due to the reduction in tillage reduction in herbicidal use and the evolution of herbicidal resistance in several species where herbicides have been applied more often. The following 9 species of ''Amaranthus'' are considered invasive and noxious weeds in the U.S and Canada: ''A. albus'' ''A. blitoides'' ''A. hybridus'' ''A. palmeri'' ''A. powellii'' ''A. retroflexus'' ''A. spinosus'' ''A. tuberculatus'' and ''A. viridis''.

A new herbicide-resistant strain of ''Amaranthus palmeri'' has appeared; it is glyphosate-resistant and so cannot be killed by herbicides using the chemical. Also this plant can survive in tough conditions. This could be of particular concern to cotton farmers using glyphosate-resistant cotton. The species ''Amaranthus palmeri'' (Palmer amaranth) causes the greatest reduction in soybean yields and has the potential to reduce yields by 17-68% in field experiments. Palmer amaranth is among the ""top five most troublesome weeds"" in the southeast of the United States and has already evolved resistances to dinitroaniline herbicides and acetolactate synthase inhibitors. This makes the proper identification of ''Amaranthus'' species at the seedling stage essential for agriculturalists. Proper weed control needs to be applied before the species successfully colonizes in the crop field and causes significant yield reductions.

702,Agarose gel electrophoresis,Properties of agarose gel,"An agarose gel cast in tray used for gel electrophoresis

Agarose gel is a three-dimensional matrix formed of helical agarose molecules in supercoiled bundles that are aggregated into three-dimensional structures with channels and pores through which biomolecules can pass. The 3-D structure is held together with hydrogen bonds and can therefore be disrupted by heating back to a liquid state. The melting temperature is different from the gelling temperature depending on the sources agarose gel has a gelling temperature of 35-42 °C and a melting temperature of 85-95 °C. Low-melting and low-gelling agaroses made through chemical modifications are also available.

Agarose gel has large pore size and good gel strength making it suitable as an anticonvection medium for the electrophoresis of DNA and large protein molecules. The pore size of a 1% gel has been estimated from 100 nm to 200-500 nm and its gel strength allows gels as dilute as 0.15% to form a slab for gel electrophoresis. Low-concentration gels (0.1 - 0.2%) however are fragile and therefore hard to handle. Agarose gel has lower resolving power than polyacrylamide gel for DNA but has a greater range of separation and is therefore used for DNA fragments of usually 50-20000 bp in size. The limit of resolution for standard agarose gel electrophoresis is around 750 kb but resolution of over 6 Mb is possible with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). It can also be used to separate large proteins and it is the preferred matrix for the gel electrophoresis of particles with effective radii larger than 5-10 nm. A 0.9% agarose gel has pores large enough for the entry of bacteriophage T4.

The agarose polymer contains charged groups in particular pyruvate and sulphate.  These negatively charged groups create a flow of water in the opposite direction to the movement of DNA in a process called electroendosmosis (EEO) and can therefore retard the movement of DNA and cause blurring of bands. Higher concentration gel would have higher electroosmotic flow. Low EEO agarose is therefore generally preferred for use in agarose gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids but high EEO agarose may be used for other purposes. The lower sulphate content of low EEO agarose particularly low-melting point (LMP) agarose is also beneficial in cases where the DNA extracted from gel is to be used for further manipulation as the presence of contaminating sulphates may affect some subsequent procedures such as ligation and PCR.  Zero EEO agaroses however are undesirable for some applications as they may be made by adding positively charged groups and such groups can affect subsequent enzyme reactions.   Electroendosmosis is a reason agarose is used in preference to agar as the agaropectin component in agar contains a significant amount of negatively charged sulphate and carboxyl groups. The removal of agaropectin in agarose substantially reduce the EEO as well as reducing the non-specific adsorption of biomolecules to the gel matrix.  However for some applications such as the electrophoresis of serum proteins a high EEO may be desirable and agaropeptin may be added in the gel used.

50,Assistive technology,Visual impairments,"
Many people with serious visual impairments live independently using a wide range of tools and techniques.  Examples of assistive technology for visually impairment include screen readers screen magnifiers Braille embossers desktop video magnifiers and voice recorders.

=== Screen readers ===


Screen readers allow the visually impaired to easily access electronic information. These software programs connect to a computer to read the text displayed out loud. There are a variety of platforms and applications available for a variety of costs.Braille is a system of raised dots representing letters numbers punctuation and words.

=== Braille and braille embossers ===

Braille is a system of raised dots formed into units called braille cells. A full braille cell is made up of six dots with two parallel rows of three dots but other combinations and quantities of dots represent other letters numbers punctuation marks or words. People can then use their fingers to read the code of raised dots.

A braille embosser is simply put a printer for braille. Instead of a standard printer adding ink onto a page the braille embosser imprints the raised dots of braille onto a page. Some braille embossers combine both braille and ink so the documents can be read with either sight or touch.

=== Desktop video magnifier ===

Desktop video magnifiers are electronic devices that use a camera and a display screen to perform digital magnification of printed materials. They enlarge printed pages for those with low vision. A camera connects to a monitor that displays real time images and the user can control settings such as magnification focus contrast underlining highlighting and other screen preferences. They come in a variety of sizes and styles; some are small and portable with handheld cameras while others are much larger and mounted on a fixed stand.

=== Screen magnification software ===

A screen magnifier is software that interfaces with a computer's graphical output to present enlarged screen content. It allows users to enlarge the texts and graphics on their computer screens for easier viewing. Similar to desktop video magnifiers this technology assists people with low vision. After the user loads the software into their computer's memory it serves as a kind of ""computer magnifying glass."" Wherever the computer cursor moves it enlarges the area around it. This allows greater computer accessibility for a wide range of visual abilities.

alt=MAGic Large Print This MAGic large-print keyboard has tactile elements and special keys for the visually impaired

=== Large-print and tactile keyboards ===
A large-print keyboard has large letters printed on the keys.  On the keyboard shown the round buttons at the top control software which can magnify the screen (zoom in) change the background color of the screen or make the mouse cursor on the screen larger.  The ""bump dots"" on the keys installed in this case by the organization using the keyboards help the user find the right keys in a tactile way.

=== Navigation Assistance ===
Assistive technology for navigation has exploded on the  IEEE Xplore database since 2000 with over 7500 engineering articles written on assistive technologies and visual impairment in the past 25 years and over 1300 articles on solving the problem of navigation for people who are blind or visually impaired. As well over 600 articles on augmented reality and visual impairment have appeared in the engineering literature since 2000. Most of these articles were published within the past 5 years and the number of articles in this area is increasing every year. GPS accelerometers gyroscopes and cameras can pinpoint the exact location of the user and provide information on what’s in the immediate vicinity and assistance in getting to a destination.

38,Agriculture,Energy and agriculture,"
Since the 1940s agricultural productivity has increased dramatically due largely to the increased use of energy-intensive mechanization fertilizers and pesticides. The vast majority of this energy input comes from fossil fuel sources. Between the 1960–65 measuring cycle and the cycle from 1986 to 1990 the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe with world grain production increasing significantly (between 70% and 390% for wheat and 60% to 150% for rice depending on geographic area) as world population doubled. Modern agriculture's heavy reliance on petrochemicals and mechanization has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output causing food shortages.

Modern or industrialized agriculture is dependent on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways: 1. direct consumption on the farm and 2. indirect consumption to manufacture inputs used on the farm. Direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery; and use of gasoline liquid propane and electricity to power dryers pumps lights heaters and coolers. American farms directly consumed about 1.2 exajoules (1.1 quadrillion BTU) in 2002 or just over 1% of the nation's total energy.

Indirect consumption is mainly oil and natural gas used to manufacture fertilizers and pesticides which accounted for 0.6 exajoules (0.6 quadrillion BTU) in 2002. The natural gas and coal consumed by the production of nitrogen fertilizer can account for over half of the agricultural energy usage. China utilizes mostly coal in the production of nitrogen fertilizer while most of Europe uses large amounts of natural gas and small amounts of coal. According to a 2010 report published by The Royal Society agriculture is increasingly dependent on the direct and indirect input of fossil fuels. Overall the fuels used in agriculture vary based on several factors including crop production system and location. The energy used to manufacture farm machinery is also a form of indirect agricultural energy consumption. Together direct and indirect consumption by US farms accounts for about 2% of the nation's energy use. Direct and indirect energy consumption by U.S. farms peaked in 1979 and has gradually declined over the past 30 years. Food systems encompass not just agricultural production but also off-farm processing packaging transporting marketing consumption and disposal of food and food-related items. Agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of food system energy use in the US.

M. King Hubbert's prediction of world petroleum production rates. Modern agriculture is totally reliant on petroleum energy

In the event of a petroleum shortage (see peak oil for global concerns) organic agriculture can be more attractive than conventional practices that use petroleum-based pesticides herbicides or fertilizers. Some studies using modern organic-farming methods have reported yields equal to or higher than those available from conventional farming. In the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union with shortages of conventional petroleum-based inputs Cuba made use of mostly organic practices including biopesticides plant-based pesticides and sustainable cropping practices to feed its populace. However organic farming may be more labor-intensive and would require a shift of the workforce from urban to rural areas. The reconditioning of soil to restore organic matter lost during the use of monoculture agriculture techniques is important to provide a reservoir of plant-available nutrients to maintain texture and to minimize erosion.

It has been suggested that rural communities might obtain fuel from the biochar and synfuel process which uses agricultural ''waste'' to provide charcoal fertilizer some fuel ''and'' food instead of the normal food vs. fuel debate. As the synfuel would be used on-site the process would be more efficient and might just provide enough fuel for a new organic-agriculture fusion.

It has been suggested that some transgenic plants may some day be developed which would allow for maintaining or increasing yields while requiring fewer fossil-fuel-derived inputs than conventional crops. The possibility of success of these programs is questioned by ecologists and economists concerned with unsustainable GMO practices such as terminator seeds. While there has been some research on sustainability using GMO crops at least one prominent multi-year attempt by Monsanto Company has been unsuccessful though during the same period traditional breeding techniques yielded a more sustainable variety of the same crop.

623,Andronikos III Palaiologos,Succession and Legacy,"Andronikos III died at Constantinople aged 44 on 15 June 1341 possibly due to chronic malaria.  Historians contend that his reign ended with the Byzantine Empire in a still-tenable situation and generally do not implicate deficiencies in his leadership in its later demise. John V Palaiologos succeeded his father as Byzantine emperor but at only 9 years of age he required a regent.

The energetic campaigns of emperor Andronikos III simply lacked sufficient strength to defeat the imperial enemies and led to several significant Byzantine reverses at the hands of Bulgarians Serbians and Ottomans.  Andronikos III nevertheless provided active leadership and cooperated with able administrators. The empire came closest to regaining a position of power in the Balkans and Greek peninsula after the Fourth Crusade. The loss of a few imperial territories in Anatolia however left the Ottoman Turks poised to expand into Europe.

Within a few months after the death of Andronikos III controversy over the right to exercise the regency over the new emperor John V Palaiologos and the position of John Kantakouzenos as all-powerful chief minister and friend of Andronikos led to the outbreak of the destructive Byzantine civil war of 1341–47 which consumed the resources of the empire and left it in an untenable position. The weakened Byzantine Empire failed to prevent the formation of the Serbian Empire or more ominously the Ottoman invasion of Europe.

410,Absolute zero,History,"Robert Boyle pioneered the idea of an absolute zero.
One of the first to discuss the possibility of an absolute minimal temperature was Robert Boyle. His 1665 ''New Experiments and Observations touching Cold'' articulated the dispute known as the ''primum frigidum''. The concept was well known among naturalists of the time. Some contended an absolute minimum temperature occurred within earth (as one of the four classical elements) others within water others air and some more recently within nitre. But all of them seemed to agree that ""There is some body or other that is of its own nature supremely cold and by participation of which all other bodies obtain that quality.""

===Limit to the ""degree of cold""===
The question whether there is a limit to the degree of coldness possible and if so where the zero must be placed was first addressed by the French physicist Guillaume Amontons in 1702 in connection with his improvements in the air-thermometer. His instrument indicated temperatures by the height at which a certain mass of air sustained a column of mercury—the volume or ""spring"" of the air varying with temperature. Amontons therefore argued that the zero of his thermometer would be that temperature at which the spring of the air was reduced to nothing. He used a scale that marked the boiling-point of water at +73 and the melting-point of ice at 51 so that the zero was equivalent to about −240 on the Celsius scale.

This close approximation to the modern value of −273.15 °C for the zero of the air-thermometer was further improved upon in 1779 by Johann Heinrich Lambert who observed that  might be regarded as absolute cold.

Values of this order for the absolute zero were not however universally accepted about this period. Pierre-Simon Laplace and Antoine Lavoisier in their 1780 treatise on heat arrived at values ranging from 1500 to 3000 below the freezing-point of water and thought that in any case it must be at least 600 below. John Dalton in his ''Chemical Philosophy'' gave ten calculations of this value and finally adopted −3000 °C as the natural zero of temperature.

===Lord Kelvin's work===
After James Prescott Joule had determined the mechanical equivalent of heat Lord Kelvin approached the question from an entirely different point of view and in 1848 devised a scale of absolute temperature that was independent of the properties of any particular substance and was based on Carnot's theory of the Motive Power of Heat and data published by Henri Victor Regnault. It followed from the principles on which this scale was constructed that its zero was placed at −273 °C at almost precisely the same point as the zero of the air-thermometer. This value was not immediately accepted; values ranging from  to   derived from laboratory measurements and observations of astronomical refraction remained in use in the early 20th century.

===The race to absolute zero===

Commemorative plaque in Leiden
With a better theoretical understanding of absolute zero scientists were eager to reach this temperature in the lab. By 1845 Michael Faraday had managed to liquefy most gases then known to exist and reached a new record for lowest temperatures by reaching . Faraday believed that certain gases such as oxygen nitrogen and hydrogen were permanent gases and could not be liquified. Decades later in 1873 Dutch theoretical scientist Johannes Diderik van der Waals demonstrated that these gases could be liquefied but only under conditions of very high pressure and very low temperatures. In 1877 Louis Paul Cailletet in France and Raoul Pictet in Switzerland succeeded in producing the first droplets of liquid air . This was followed in 1883 by the production of liquid oxygen  by the Polish professors Zygmunt Wróblewski and Karol Olszewski.

Scottish chemist and physicist James Dewar and rival Heike Kamerlingh Onnes took on the challenge to liquefy the remaining gases hydrogen and helium. In 1898 after 20 years of effort Dewar was first to liquefy hydrogen reaching a new low temperature record of . However Onnes his rival was the first to liquefy helium in 1908 using several precooling stages and the Hampson–Linde cycle. He lowered the temperature to the boiling point of helium . By reducing the pressure of the liquid helium he achieved an even lower temperature near 1.5 K. These were the coldest temperatures achieved on earth at the time and his achievement earned him the Nobel Prize in 1913. Onnes would continue to study the properties of materials at temperatures near absolute zero describing superconductivity and superfluids for the first time.

667,Economy of Alberta,Sectors,"
===Industry===
Alberta is the largest producer of conventional crude oil synthetic crude natural gas and gas products in the country. Alberta is the world’s 2nd largest exporter of natural gas and the 4th largest producer. Two of the largest producers of petrochemicals in North America are located in central and north central Alberta. In both Red Deer and Edmonton world class polyethylene and vinyl manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world and Edmonton's oil refineries provide the raw materials for a large petrochemical industry to the east of Edmonton.

The Athabasca Oil Sands (sometimes known as the Athabasca Tar sands) have estimated unconventional oil reserves approximately equal to the conventional oil reserves of the rest of the world estimated to be . With the development of new extraction methods such as steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) which was developed in Alberta bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional strip mining and non-conventional in situ methods to extract the bitumen from the oil sands. With current technology and at current prices about  of bitumen are recoverable. Fort McMurray one of Canada's fastest growing cities has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.

Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands was the price of oil. The oil price increases since 2003 made it more than profitable to extract this oil which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.

Alberta's economy was negatively impacted by the 2015-2016 oil glut with a record high volume of worldwide oil inventories in storage with global crude oil collapsing at near ten-year low prices. The United States doubled its 2008 production levels mainly due to substantial improvements in shale ""fracking"" technology OPEC members consistently exceeded their production ceiling and China experienced a marked slowdown in economic growth and crude oil imports.

With concerted effort and support from the provincial government several high-tech industries have found their birth in Alberta notably patents related to interactive liquid-crystal display systems. With a growing economy Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds.

=====Oil and gas=====
Drilling rig in Alberta.


Since the early 1940s Alberta had supplied oil and gas to the rest of Canada and the United States. The Athabasca River region produces oil for internal and external use. The Athabasca Oil Sands contain the largest proven reserves of oil in the world outside Saudi Arabia. Natural gas has been found at several points and in 1999 the production of natural gas liquids (ethane propane and butanes) totalled  valued at $2.27 billion. Alberta also provides 13% of all the natural gas used in the United States.

Notable gas reserves were discovered in the 1883 near Medicine Hat.  The town of Medicine Hat began using gas for lighting the town and supplying light and fuel for the people and a number of industries using the gas for manufacturing. In fact a large glassworks was established at Redcliff. When Rudyard Kipling visited Medicine Hat he described it as the city ""with all hell for a basement"".

======Basic statistics======

* In 2003 Alberta produced  of conventional light medium and heavy crude plus an additional  of pentanes plus used for blending with heavy crude oil and bitumen to facilitate its transportation through pipelines.
* Alberta exports over  of oil to US markets accounting for 10 per cent of US oil imports.
* The conventional oil resource is estimated to have approximately  of remaining established reserves.
*Conventional crude oil production (not including oil sands and pentanes plus) represented 38.6% of Alberta ’s total crude oil and equivalent production and 25.5% of Canada’s total crude oil and equivalent production.
*Alberta's oil sands reserve is considered to be one of the largest in the world containing  of bitumen initially in place. Of this total  are considered to be remaining established reserves recoverable using current technology under present and anticipated economic conditions. To date about 2% of the initial established resource has been produced.
* In 2003 total crude bitumen production in Alberta averaged .
* Disposition of Alberta ’s total crude oil and equivalent production in 2003 was approximately:
** 62% to the United States
** 24% within Alberta
** 14% to the rest of Canada
* In 2003 Alberta produced  of marketable natural gas.
* The average Albertan household uses  of natural gas a year.
* Over 80 per cent of Canada’s natural gas production is from Alberta.
* In 2006 Alberta consumed  of natural gas. The rest was exported across Canada and to the United States.
* Royalties to Alberta from natural gas and its byproducts are larger than royalties from crude oil and bitumen.
* In 2006 there were 13473 successful natural gas wells drilled in Alberta: 12029 conventional gas wells and 1444 coalbed methane wells
* There may be up to  of coalbed methane in Alberta although it is unknown how much of this gas might be recoverable.
* Alberta has one of the most extensive natural gas systems in the world as part of its energy infrastructure with  of energy related pipelines.

=====Coal=====
Remains of the former Atlas Coal Mine near Drumheller now a National Historic Site of Canada.

Coal has been mined in Alberta since the late 19th century. Over 1800 mines have operated in Alberta since then.

The coal industry was vital to the early development of several communities especially those in the foothills and along deep river valleys where coal was close to the surface.

Alberta is still a major coal producer every two weeks Alberta produces enough coal to fill the Sky Dome in Toronto.

Much of that coal is burned in Alberta for electricity generation. Alberta uses over 25 million tonnes of coal annually to generate electricity.

Alberta has vast coal resources and 70 per cent of Canada's coal reserves are located in Alberta. This amounts to 33.6 Gigatonnes.

Vast beds of coal are found extending for hundreds of miles a short distance below the surface of the plains. The coal belongs to the Cretaceous beds and while not so heavy as that of the Coal Measures in England is of excellent quality. In the valley of the Bow River alongside the Canadian Pacific Railway valuable beds of anthracite coal are still worked. The usual coal deposits of the area of bituminous or semi-bituminous coal. These are largely worked at Lethbridge in southern Alberta and Edmonton in the centre of the province. Many other parts of the province have pits for private use.

=====Electricity=====


 Alberta's generating capacity was 16261 MW and Alberta has about  of transmission lines.

Alberta has 1491 megawatts of wind power capacity.

====Mineral mining====

Building stones mined in Alberta include Rundle stone and Paskapoo sandstone.

Diamonds were first found in Alberta in 1958 and many stones have been found since although to date no large-scale mines have been developed.

====Manufacturing====
The Edmonton area and in particular Nisku is a major centre for manufacturing oil and gas related equipment. As well Edmonton's Refinery Row is home to a petrochemical industry.

According to a Statistics Canada report Alberta's manufacturing sales year-over-year sales fell 13.2 per cent with a loss of almost four per cent from December to January. Alberta's economy continued to shrink because of the collapse of the oil and gas sector. The petroleum and coal product manufacturing industry is now third— behind food and chemicals.

====Biotechnology====
Several companies and services in the biotech sector are clustered around the University of Alberta for example ColdFX.

====Food processing====
Owing to the strength of agriculture food processing was once a major part of the economies of Edmonton and Calgary but this sector has increasingly moved to smaller centres such as Brooks the home of XL Foods responsible for one third of Canada's beef processing in 2011.

====Transportation====
Headquarters of the airline WestJet in Calgary.
Edmonton is a major distribution centre for northern communities hence the nickname ""Gateway to the North"". Edmonton is one CN Rail's most important hubs. Since 1996 Canadian Pacific Railway has its headquarters in downtown Calgary.

WestJet Canada's second largest air carrier is headquartered in Calgary by Calgary International Airport which serves as the airline's primary hub. Prior to its dissolution Canadian Airlines was headquartered in Calgary by the airport. Prior to its dissolution Air Canada subsidiary Zip was headquartered in Calgary.

===Agriculture and forestry===

==== Agriculture ====

In the past cattle horses and sheep were reared in the southern prairie region on ranches or smaller holdings. Currently Alberta produces cattle valued at over $3.3 billion as well as other livestock in lesser quantities. In this region irrigation is widely used.  Wheat accounting for almost half of the $2 billion agricultural economy is supplemented by canola barley rye sugar beets and other mixed farming. In 2011 Alberta producers seeded an estimated total of  to spring wheat durum barley oats mixed grains triticale canola and dry peas.  Of the total seeded area 94 per cent was harvested as grains and oilseeds and six per cent as greenfeed and silage.

Agriculture has a significant position in the province's economy. Over three million cattle are residents of the province at one time or another and Albertan beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains buffalo (bison) for the consumer market. Sheep for wool and lamb are also raised.

Wheat and canola are primary farm crops with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production with other grains also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province the once common grain elevator is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points.

Alberta is the leading beekeeping province of Canada with some beekeepers wintering hives indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta then migrating north during the summer into the Peace River valley where the season is short but the working days are long for honeybees to produce honey from clover and fireweed. Hybrid canola also requires bee pollination and some beekeepers service this need.

==== Forestry ====


The vast northern forest reserves of softwood allow Alberta to produce large quantities of lumber oriented strand board (OSB) and plywood and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the Pacific Rim nations with bleached wood pulp and newsprint.

In 1999 lumber products from Alberta were valued at $4.1 billion of which 72% were exported around the world. Since forests cover approximately 59% of the province's land area the government allows about  to be harvested annually from the forests on public lands.

===Services===
Despite the high profile of the extractive industries Alberta has a mature economy and most people work in services. In 2014 there were 1635.8 thousand people employed in the services-producing sector. By January 2016 that number had increased to 1668.5 thousand and by February 2016 to 1670.6 thousand. This includes wholesale and retail trade; transportation and warehousing; finance insurance real estate rental and leasing; professional scientific and technical services; business building and other support services; educational services; health care and social assistance; information culture and recreation; accommodation and food services; other services (except public administration) and public administration.

====Finance====
The TSX Venture Exchange is headquartered in Calgary and Calgary also has a robust service industry relating to the securities market. The city has the second highest number of corporate head offices in Canada after Toronto and the financial services industry in Calgary has developed to support them.

Edmonton hosts the headquarters of the only major Canadian banks west of Toronto: Canadian Western Bank and ATB Financial as well as the only province-wide credit union Servus.

====Government====
Despite Alberta's reputation as a ""small government"" province many health care and education professionals are lured to Alberta from other provinces by the higher wages the Alberta government is able to offer because of oil revenues. In 2014 the median household income in Alberta was $100000 with the average weekly wage at $1163—23 per cent higher than the Canadian national average. Alberta has the ""lowest taxes overall of any province or territory"" in Canada.

50,Assistive technology,Assistive technology in sport,"A New York City Marathon competitor uses a racing wheelchair
Assistive technology in sport is an area of technology design that is growing. Assistive technology is the array of new devices created to enable sports enthusiasts who have disabilities to play. Assistive technology may be used in adaptive sports where an existing sport is modified to enable players with a disability to participate; or assistive technology may be used to invent completely new sports with athletes with disabilities exclusively in mind.

An increasing number of people with disabilities are participating in sports leading to the development of new assistive technology. Assistive technology devices can be simple or ""low-tech"" or they may use highly advanced technology with some even using computers. Assistive technology for sports may also be simple or advanced. Accordingly assistive technology can be found in sports ranging from local community recreation to the elite Paralympic Games. More complex assistive technology devices have been developed over time and as a result sports for people with disabilities ""have changed from being a clinical therapeutic tool to an increasingly competition-oriented activity"".

Called ''al-Nasir li-Din Allah'' (""the Defender of God's Faith"") he ascended the throne in his early 20s and reigned for half a century as the most powerful prince of Iberia. Although people of all creeds enjoyed tolerance and freedom of religion under his rule he repelled the Fatimids partly by supporting their Maghrawa enemies in North Africa and partly by claiming the title Caliph (ruler of the Islamic world) for himself.

The most basic stressors include:  
* High winds
* Extreme temperatures
* Drought
* Flood
* Other natural disasters such as tornadoes and wildfires.

Lesser-known stressors generally occur on a smaller scale. They include: poor edaphic conditions like rock content and pH levels high radiation compaction contamination and other highly specific conditions like rapid rehydration during seed germination.

1096,Abba Arika,Rav reproves extreme asceticism,"Rav loved the ''Book of Ecclesiasticus'' (Sirach) and warned his disciple Hamnuna against unjustifiable asceticism by quoting advice contained therein—that considering the transitoriness of human life (''Eruvin'' 54a) one should not despise the good things of this world. To the celestial joys of the future he was accustomed to refer in the following poetic words: (''Berakhot'' 17a)

:""There is naught on earth to compare with the future life. In the world to come there shall be neither eating nor drinking neither trading nor toil neither hatred nor envy; but the righteous shall sit with crowns upon their heads and rejoice in the radiance of the Divine Presence"".

Rav also devoted much attention to mystical and transcendental speculations which the rabbis connect with the Biblical account of creation (''Genesis'' 1 ''Ma'aseh Bereshit'') the vision of the mysterious chariot of God (''Ezekiel'' 1 ''Ma'aseh Merkabah'') and the Divine Name. Many of his important utterances testify to his tendency in this direction (''Hagigah'' 12a ''Kiddushin'' 71a).

1041,Administrative law,In civil law countries,"

Unlike most common-law jurisdictions the majority of civil law jurisdictions have specialized courts or sections to deal with administrative cases which as a rule will apply procedural rules specifically designed for such cases and different from that applied in private-law proceedings such as contract or tort claims.

=== Brazil ===

In Brazil unlike most Civil-law jurisdictions there is no specialized court or section to deal with administrative cases. In 1998 a constitutional reform led by the government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso introduced regulatory agencies as a part of the executive branch. Since 1988 Brazilian administrative law has been strongly influenced by the judicial interpretations of the constitutional principles of public administration (art. 37 of Federal Constitution): legality impersonality publicity of administrative acts morality and efficiency.

=== Chile ===


The President of the Republic exercises the administrative function in collaboration with several Ministries or other authorities with ''ministerial rank''. Each Ministry has one or more under-secretary that performs through public services the actual satisfaction of public needs. There is not a single specialized court to deal with actions against the Administrative entities but instead there are several specialized courts and procedures of review.

=== People's Republic of China ===


Administrative law in the People's Republic of China was virtually non-existent before the economic reform era initiated by Deng Xiaoping. Since the 1980s the People's Republic of China has constructed a new legal framework for administrative law establishing control mechanisms for overseeing the bureaucracy and disciplinary committees for the Communist Party of China. However many have argued that the usefulness of these laws is vastly inadequate in terms of controlling government actions largely because of institutional and systemic obstacles like a weak judiciary poorly trained judges and lawyers and corruption.

In 1990 the Administrative Supervision Regulations (行政检查条例) and the Administrative Reconsideration Regulations (行政复议条例) were passed. The 1993 State Civil Servant Provisional Regulations (国家公务员暂行条例) changed the way government officials were selected and promoted requiring that they pass exams and yearly appraisals and introduced a rotation system. The three regulations have been amended and upgraded into laws. In 1994 the State Compensation Law (国家赔偿法) was passed followed by the Administrative Penalties Law (行政处罚法) in 1996. Administrative Compulsory Law was enforced in 2012. Administrative Litigation Law was amended in 2014. The General Administrative Procedure Law is under way.

=== France ===

In France most claims against the national or local governments as well as claims against private bodies providing public services  are handled by administrative courts which use the ''Conseil d'État'' (Council of State) as a court of last resort for both ordinary and special courts. The main administrative courts are the ''tribunaux administratifs'' and appeal courts are the ''cours administratives d'appel''. Special administrative courts include the National Court of Asylum Right as well as military medical and judicial disciplinary bodies. The French body of administrative law is called ""''droit administratif''"".

Over the course of their history France's administrative courts have developed an extensive and coherent case law (''jurisprudence constante'') and legal doctrine (''principes généraux du droit'' and ''principes fondamentaux reconnus par les lois de la République'') often before similar concepts were enshrined in constitutional and legal texts. These principes include:

*Right to fair trial (''droit à la défense'') including for internal disciplinary bodies
*Right to challenge any administrative decision before an administrative court (''droit au recours'') 
*Equal treatment of public service users (''égalité devant le service public'') 
*Equal access to government employment (''égalité d'accès à la fonction publique'') without regard for political opinions 
*Freedom of association (''liberté d'association'') 
*Right to Entrepreneurship (''Liberté du Commerce et de l'industrie'' lit. freedom of commerce and industry) 
*Right to Legal certainty (''Droit à la sécurité juridique'') 

French administrative law which is the founder of Continental administrative law has a strong influence on administrative laws in several other countries such as Belgium Greece Turkey and Tunisia.



=== Germany ===

Administrative law in Germany called ""'''Verwaltungsrecht'''"" :de:Verwaltungsrecht (Deutschland) generally rules the relationship between authorities and the citizens and therefore it establishes citizens' rights and obligations against the
authorities. It is a part of the public law which deals with the organization the tasks and the acting of the public administration. It also contains rules regulations orders and decisions created by and related to administrative agencies such as federal agencies federal state authorities urban administrations but also admission offices and fiscal authorities etc. Administrative law in Germany follows three basic principles.

* Principle of the legality of the authority which means that there is no acting against the law and no acting without a law.
* Principle of legal security which includes a principle of legal certainty and the principle of nonretroactivity
* Principle of proportionality which says that an act of an authority has to be suitable necessary and appropriate

Administrative law in Germany can be divided into '''general administrative law''' and '''special administrative law'''.

==== General administrative law ====

The general administration law is basically ruled in the administrative procedures law (''Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz'' VwVfG). Other legal sources are the Rules of the Administrative Courts (Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung VwGO) the social security code (Sozialgesetzbuch SGB) and the general fiscal law (Abgabenordnung AO).

===== Administrative procedures Law =====

The ''Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz'' (VwVfG) which was enacted in 1977 regulates the main administrative procedures of the federal government. It serves the purpose to ensure a treatment in accordance with the rule of law by the public authority. Furthermore it contains the regulations for mass processes and expands the legal protection against the authorities. The VwVfG basically applies for the entire public administrative activities of federal agencies as well as federal state authorities in case of making federal law. One of the central clause is § 35 VwVfG. It defines the administrative act the most common form of action in which the public administration occurs against a citizen. The definition in § 35  says that an administration act is characterized by the following features:

It is an official act of an authority in the field of public law to resolve an individual case with effect to the outside.

§§ 36 – 39 §§ 58 – 59 and § 80 VwV––fG rule the structure and the necessary elements of the
administrative act. § 48 and § 49 VwVfG have a high relevance in practice as well. In these
paragraphs the prerequisites for redemption of an unlawful administration act (§ 48 VwVfG ) and
withdrawal of a lawful administration act (§ 49 VwVfG ) are listed.

===== Other legal sources =====

Administration procedural law (Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung VwGO) which was enacted in 1960 rules the court procedures at the administrative court. The VwGO is divided into five parts which are the constitution of the courts action remedies and retrial costs and enforcement15 and final clauses and temporary arrangements.

In absence of a rule the VwGO is supplemented by the code of civil procedure (Zivilprozessordnung ZPO) and the judicature act (Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz GVG). In addition to the regulation of the administrative procedure the VwVfG also constitutes the legal protection in administrative law beyond the court procedure. § 68 VwVGO rules the preliminary proceeding called ""Vorverfahren"" or ""Widerspruchsverfahren"" which is a stringent prerequisite for the administrative procedure if an action for rescission or a writ of mandamus against an authority is aimed. The preliminary proceeding gives each citizen feeling unlawfully mistreated by an authority the possibility to object and to force a review of an administrative act without going to court. The prerequisites to open the public law remedy are listed in § 40 I VwGO. Therefore it is necessary to have the existence of a conflict in public law  without any constitutional aspects and no assignment to another jurisdiction.

The social security code (Sozialgesetzbuch SGB) and the general fiscal law are less important for the administrative law. They supplement the VwVfG and the VwGO in the fields of taxation and social legislation such as social welfare or financial support for students (BaFÖG) etc.

==== Special administrative law ====

The special administrative law consists of various laws. Each special sector has its own law. The most important ones are the

* Town and Country Planning Code (Baugesetzbuch BauGB)
* Federal Control of Pollution Act (Bundesimmissionsschutzgesetz BImSchG)
* Industrial Code (Gewerbeordnung GewO)
* Police Law (Polizei- und Ordnungsrecht)
* Statute Governing Restaurants (Gaststättenrecht GastG).

In Germany the highest administrative court for most matters is the federal administrative court Bundesverwaltungsgericht. There are federal courts with special jurisdiction in the fields of social security law (Bundessozialgericht) and tax law (Bundesfinanzhof).



=== Italy ===
Administrative law in Italy known as ""'''Diritto amministrativo''"" is a branch of public law whose rules govern the organization of the public administration and the activities of the pursuit of the public interest of the public administration and the relationship between this and the citizens.
Its genesis is related to the principle of division of powers of the State. The administrative power originally called ""executive"" is to organize resources and people whose function is devolved to achieve the public interest objectives as defined by the law.

=== The Netherlands ===

In The Netherlands administrative law provisions are usually contained in separate laws. There is however a single General Administrative Law Act (""Algemene wet bestuursrecht"" or Awb) that applies both to the making of administrative decisions and the judicial review of these decisions in courts. On the basis of the Awb citizens can oppose a decision ('besluit') made by an administrative agency ('bestuursorgaan') within the administration and apply for judicial review in courts if unsuccessful.

Unlike France or Germany there are no special administrative courts of first instance in the Netherlands but regular courts have an administrative ""chamber"" which specializes in administrative appeals. The courts of appeal in administrative cases however are specialized depending on the case but most administrative appeals end up in the judicial section of the Council of State (Raad van State).

Before going to court citizens must usually first object to the decision with the administrative body who made it. This is called ""bezwaar"". This procedure allows for the administrative body to correct possible mistakes themselves and is used to filter cases before going to court. Sometimes instead of bezwaar a different system is used called ""administratief beroep"" (administrative appeal). The difference with bezwaar is that administratief beroep is filed with a different administrative body usually a higher ranking one than the administrative body that made the primary decision. Administratief beroep is available only if the law on which the primary decision is based specifically provides for it. An example involves objecting to a traffic ticket with the district attorney (""officier van justitie"") after which the decision can be appealed in court.

In addition Netherlands General Administrative Law Act (GALA) is a rather good sample of procedural laws in Europe

=== Sweden ===

The Stenbockska Palace is the seat of the Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden.

In Sweden there is a system of administrative courts that considers only administrative law cases and is completely separate from the system of general courts. This system has three tiers with 12 county administrative courts (''förvaltningsrätt'') as the first tier four administrative courts of appeal (''kammarrätt'') as the second tier and the Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden (''Högsta Förvaltningsdomstolen'') as the third tier.

Migration cases are handled in a two-tier system effectively within the system general administrative courts. Three of the administrative courts serve as migration courts (''migrationsdomstol'') with the Administrative Court of Appeal in Stockholm serving as the Migration Court of Appeal (''Migrationsöverdomstolen'').

=== Turkey ===
In Turkey the lawsuits against the acts and actions of the national or local governments and public bodies are handled by administrative courts which are the main administrative courts. The decisions of the administrative courts are checked by the Regional Administrative Courts and Council of State.  Council of State as a court of last resort is exactly similar to Conseil d'État in France.

=== Ukraine ===


As a homogeneous legal substance isolated in a system of jurisprudence the administrative law of Ukraine is characterized as: (1) a branch of law; (2) a science; (3) a discipline.

1100,Abd al-Rahman I,Biography,"
===Flight from Damascus===
Born near Damascus in Syria Abd al-Rahman was the son of the Umayyad prince Mu'awiya ibn Hisham and a Berber mother and thus the grandson of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik caliph from 724 to 743. He was twenty when his family the ruling Umayyads were overthrown by the Abbasid Revolution in 748–750. Abd al-Rahman and a small part of his family fled Damascus where the center of Umayyad power had been; people moving with him include his brother Yahya his four-year-old son Sulayman and some of his sisters as well as his Greek freedman Bedr. The family fled from Damascus to the River Euphrates. All along the way the path was filled with danger as the Abbasids had dispatched horsemen across the region to try to find the Umayyad prince and kill him. The Abbasids were merciless with all Umayyads that they found. Abbasid agents closed in on Abd al-Rahman and his family while they were hiding in a small village. He left his young son with his sisters and fled with Yahya. Accounts vary but Bedr likely initially escaped with Abd ar-Rahman. Some histories indicate that Bedr met up with Abd al-Rahman at a later date.

Abd al-Rahman Yahya and Bedr quit the village narrowly escaping the Abbasid assassins. Later on the way south Abbasid horsemen again caught up with the trio: Abd al-Rahman and his companions then threw themselves into the River Euphrates. While trying to swim across the dangerous Euphrates Abd al-Rahman is said to have become separated from his brother Yahya who began swimming back towards the horsemen possibly from fear of drowning. The horsemen begged the escapers to return promising that no harm would come to them. The 17th-century historian Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari poignantly described Abd al-Rahman's reaction as he implored Yahya to keep going: ""O brother! Come to me come to me!"" Yahya returned to the near shore and was quickly dispatched by the horsemen. They cut the head off their prize leaving Yahya's body to rot. Al-Maqqari quotes prior Muslim historians as having recorded that Abd al-Rahman said he was so overcome with fear at that moment that once he made the far shore he ran until exhaustion overcame him. Only he and Bedr were left to face the unknown.

===Exile years===
After barely escaping with their lives Abd al-Rahman and Bedr continued south through Palestine the Sinai and then into Egypt. Abd al-Rahman had to keep a low profile as he traveled. It may be assumed that he intended to go at least as far as northwestern Africa (Maghreb) the land of his mother which had been partly conquered by his Umayyad predecessors. The journey across Egypt would prove perilous. At the time Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Fihri was the semi-autonomous governor of Ifriqiya (roughly modern Tunisia) and a former Umayyad client. The ambitious Ibn Habib a member of the illustrious Fihrid family had long sought to carve out Ifriqiya as a private dominion for himself. At first he sought an understanding with the Abbasids but when they refused his terms and demanded his submission Ibn Habib broke openly with the Abbasids and invited the remnants of the Umayyad dynasty to take refuge in his dominions. Abd al-Rahman was only one of several surviving Umayyad family members to make their way to Ifriqiya at this time.

But Ibn Habib soon changed his mind. He feared the presence of prominent Umayyad exiles in Ifriqiya a family more illustrious than his own might become a focal point for intrigue among local nobles against his own usurped powers. Around 755 believing he had discovered plots involving some of the more prominent Umayyad exiles in Kairouan Ibn Habib turned against them. At the time Abd al-Rahman and Bedr were keeping a low profile staying in Kabylie at the camp of a Nafza Berber chieftain friendly to their plight. Ibn Habib dispatched spies to look for the Umayyad prince. When Ibn Habib's soldiers entered the camp the Berber chieftain's wife Tekfah hid Abd al-Rahman under her personal belongings to help him go unnoticed. Once they were gone Abd a-Rahman and Bedr immediately set off westwards.

In 755 Abd al-Rahman and Bedr reached modern-day Morocco near Ceuta. Their next step would be to cross the sea to al-Andalus where Abd al-Rahman could not have been sure whether or not he would be welcomed. Following the Berber Revolt of the 740s the province was in a state of confusion with the Muslim community torn by tribal dissensions among the Arabs (the Qays–Yemeni feud) and racial tensions between the Arabs and Berbers. At that moment the nominal ruler of al-Andalus emir Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri—another member of the Fihrid family and a favorite of the old Arab settlers (''baladiyun'') mostly of south Arabian or ""Yemeni"" tribal stock—was locked in a contest with his vizier (and son-in-law) al-Sumayl ibn Hatim al-Kilabi the head of the ""Syrians""—the ''shamiyum'' drawn from the ''junds'' or military regiments of Syria mostly of north Arabian Qaysid tribes—who had arrived in 742.

Among the Syrian ''junds'' were contingents of old Umayyad clients numbering perhaps 500 and Abd al-Rahman believed he might tug on old loyalties and get them to receive him. Bedr was dispatched across the straits to make contact. Bedr managed to line up three Syrian commanders—Ubayd Allah ibn Uthman and Abd Allah ibn Khalid both originally of Damascus and Yusuf ibn Bukht of Qinnasrin. The trio approached the Syrian arch-commander al-Sumayl (then in Zaragoza) to get his consent but al-Sumayl refused fearing Abd al-Rahman would try to make himself emir. As a result Bedr and the Umayyad clients sent out feelers to their rivals the Yemenite commanders. Although the Yemenites were not natural allies (the Umayyads are a Qaysid tribe) their interest was piqued. The emir Yusuf al-Fihri had proven himself unable to keep the powerful al-Sumayl in check and several Yemenite chieftains felt their future prospects were poor whether in a Fihrid or Syrian-dominated Spain so that they had a better chance of advancement if they hitched themselves to the glitter of the Umayyad name. Although the Umayyads did not have a historical presence in the region (no member of the Umayyad family was known to have ever set foot in al-Andalus before) and there were grave concerns about young Abd al-Rahman's inexperience several of the lower-ranking Yemenite commanders felt they had little to lose and much to gain and agreed to support the prince.

Bedr returned to Africa to tell Abd al-Rahman of the invitation of the Umayyad clients in al-Andalus. Shortly thereafter they set off with a small group of followers for Europe. When some local Berber tribesmen learned of Abd al-Rahman's intent to set sail for al-Andalus they quickly rode to catch up with him on the coast. The tribesmen might have figured that they could hold Abd al-Rahman as hostage and force him to buy his way out of Africa. He did indeed hand over some amount of dinars to the suddenly hostile local Berbers. Just as Abd al-Rahman launched his boat another group of Berbers arrived. They also tried to obtain a fee from him for leaving. One of the Berbers held on to Abd al-Rahman's vessel as it made for al-Andalus and allegedly had his hand cut off by one of the boat's crew.

Abd al-Rahman landed at Almuñécar in al-Andalus to the east of Málaga in September 755; however his landing site was unconfirmed.

===Fight for power===
Statue of Abd al-Rahman I in Almuñécar Spain
Upon landing in al-Andalus Abd al-Rahman was greeted by clients Abu Uthman and Ibn Khalid and an escort of 300 cavalry. During his brief time in Málaga he was able to amass local support quickly. Waves of people made their way to Málaga to pay respect to the prince they thought was dead including many of the aforementioned Syrians. One famous story that persisted through history related to a gift Abd al-Rahman was given while in Málaga. The gift was a beautiful young slave girl but Abd al-Rahman humbly returned her to her previous master.

News of the prince's arrival spread like wildfire throughout the peninsula. During this time emir al-Fihri and the Syrian commander al-Sumayl pondered what to do about the new threat to their shaky hold on power. They decided to try to marry Abd al-Rahman into their family. If that did not work then Abd al-Rahman would have to be killed. Abd al-Rahman was apparently sagacious enough to expect such a plot. In order to help speed his ascension to power he was prepared to take advantage of the feuds and dissensions. However before anything could be done trouble broke out in northern al-Andalus. Zaragoza an important trade city on the Upper March of al-Andalus made a bid for autonomy. Al-Fihri and al-Sumayl rode north to quash the rebellion. This might have been fortunate timing for Abd al-Rahman since he was still getting a solid foothold in al-Andalus. By March 756 Abd al-Rahman and his growing following of Umayyad clients and Yemenite ''junds'' were able to take Sevilla without violence. He managed to break the rebellion attempt in Zaragoza but just about that time the Cordovan governor received news of a Basque rebellion in Pamplona. An important detachment was sent by Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman to quash it but his troops were annihilated. After the setback al-Fihri turned his army back south to face the ""pretender"". The fight for the right to rule al-Andalus was about to begin. The two contingents met on opposite sides of the River Guadalquivir just outside the capital of Córdoba on the plains of Musarah.

The river was for the first time in years overflowing its banks heralding the end of a long drought. Nevertheless food was still scarce and Abd al-Rahman's army suffered from hunger. In an attempt to demoralize Abd al-Rahman's troops al-Fihri ensured that his troops not only were well fed but also ate gluttonous amounts of food in full view of the Umayyad lines. An attempt at negotiations soon followed in which it is likely that Abd al-Rahman was offered the hand of al-Fihri's daughter in marriage and great wealth. Abd ar-Rahman however would settle for nothing less than control of the emirate and an impasse was reached. Even before the fight began dissension spread through some of Abd al-Rahman's lines. Specifically the Yemeni Arabs were unhappy that the prince was mounted on a fine Spanish steed. And the prince's mettle was untried in battle after all! The Yemenis observed significantly that such a fine horse would provide an excellent mount to escape from battle.

Being the ever-wary politician Abd al-Rahman acted quickly to regain Yemeni support and rode to a Yemeni chief who was mounted on a mule named ""Lightning"". Abd al-Rahman averred that his horse proved difficult to ride and was wont to buck him out of the saddle. He offered to exchange his horse for the mule a deal to which the surprised chief readily agreed. The swap quelled the simmering Yemeni rebellion. Soon both armies were in their lines on the same bank of the Guadalquivir. Abd al-Rahman had no banner and so one was improvised by unwinding a green turban and binding it round the head of a spear. Subsequently the turban and the spear became the banner and symbol of the Andalusian Umayyads. Abd al-Rahman led the charge toward al-Fihri's army. Al-Sumayl in turn advanced his cavalry out to meet the Umayyad threat. After a long and difficult fight ""Abd ar-Rahman obtained a most complete victory and the field was strewn with the bodies of the enemy."". Both al-Fihri and al-Sumayl managed to escape the field (probably) with parts of the army too. Abd al-Rahman triumphantly marched into the capital Córdoba. Danger was not far behind as al-Fihri planned a counterattack. He reorganized his forces and set out for the capital Abd al-Rahman had usurped from him. Again Abd al-Rahman met al-Fihri with his army; this time negotiations were successful although the terms were somewhat changed. In exchange for al-Fihri's life and wealth he would be a prisoner and not allowed to leave the city limits of Córdoba. Al-Fihri would have to report once a day to Abd al-Rahman as well as turn over some of his sons and daughters as hostages. For a while al-Fihri met the obligations of the one-sided truce but he still had many people loyal to him; people who would have liked to see him back in power.

Al-Fihri eventually did make another bid for power. He quit Córdoba and quickly started gathering supporters. While at large al-Fihri managed to gather an army allegedly numbering to 20000. It is doubtful however that his troops were ""regular"" soldiers but rather a hodge-podge of men from various parts of al-Andalus. Abd ar-Rahman's appointed governor in Sevilla took up the chase and after a series of small fights managed to defeat al-Fihri's army. Al-Fihri himself managed to escape to the former Visigoth capital of Toledo in central al-Andalus; once there he was promptly killed. Al-Fihri's head was sent to Córdoba where Abd al-Rahman had it nailed to a bridge. With this act Abd ar-Rahman proclaimed himself the emir of al-Andalus. However one final act to take over southern Iberia had to be performed: al-Fihri's general al-Sumayl had to be dealt with and he was garroted in Córdoba's jail. Now most of central and northern al-Andalus (Toledo Zaragoza Barcelona etc.) was out of his rule with large swathes remaining in the hands of Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri's supporters until 779 (submission of Zaragoza).

===Rule===
It is unclear whether Abd al-Rahman proclaimed himself caliph. There are documents in the archives of Cordoba that state that this was his first act upon entering the city. He himself believed he was destined to be Caliph because of prophesies he had heard as a boy so it seems likely he would. However historically he is recorded as Emir and not Caliph. Abd al-Rahman's 7th descendent Abd al-Rahman III would however take up the title of caliph. In the meantime a call went out through the Muslim world that al-Andalus was a safe haven for friends of the house of Umayya if not for Abd al-Rahman's scattered family that managed to evade the Abbasids. Abd al-Rahman probably was quite happy to see his call answered by waves of Umayyad faithful and family. He was finally reacquainted with his son Sulayman whom he last saw weeping on the banks of the Euphrates with his sisters. Abd ar-Rahman's sisters were unable to make the long voyage to al-Andalus. Abd al-Rahman placed his family members in high offices across the land as he felt he could trust them more than non-family. The Umayyad family would again grow large and prosperous over successive generations. However by 763 Abd ar-Rahman had to get back to the business of war. Al-Andalus had been invaded by an Abbasid army.

Far away in Baghdad the current Abbasid caliph al-Mansur had long been planning to depose the Umayyad who dared to call himself emir of al-Andalus. Al-Mansur installed al-Ala ibn-Mugith (also known as al-Ala) as governor of Africa (whose title gave him dominion over the province of al-Andalus). It was al-Ala who headed the Abbasid army that landed in al-Andalus possibly near Beja (in modern-day Portugal). Much of the surrounding area of Beja capitulated to al-Ala and in fact rallied under the Abbasid banners against Abd al-Rahman. Abd al-Rahman had to act quickly. The Abbasid contingent was vastly superior in size said to have numbered 7000 men. The emir quickly made for the redoubt of Carmona with his army. The Abbasid army was fast on their heels and laid siege to Carmona for approximately two months. Abd al-Rahman must have sensed that time was against him as food and water became scarce and his troops morale likely came into question. Finally Abd al-Rahman gathered his men as he was ""resolved on an audacious sally"". Abd al-Rahman hand-picked 700 fighters from his army and led them to Carmona's main gate. There he started a great fire and threw his scabbard into the flames. Abd al-Rahman told his men that time had come to go down fighting rather than die of hunger.
The gate lifted and Abd ar-Rahman's men fell upon the unsuspecting Abbasids thoroughly routing them. Most of the Abbasid army was killed. The heads of the main Abbasid leaders were cut off. Their heads were preserved in salt and identifying tags pinned to their ears. The heads were bundled together in a gruesome package and sent to the Abbasid caliph who was on pilgrimage at Mecca. Upon receiving the evidence of al-Ala's defeat in al-Andalus al-Mansur is said to have gasped ""God be praised for placing a sea between us!"" Al-Mansur hated and yet apparently respected Abd al-Rahman to such a degree that he dubbed him the ""Hawk of Quraysh"" (The Umayyads were from a branch of the Quraysh tribe.)

Despite such a tremendous victory Abd al-Rahman had to continuously put down rebellions in al-Andalus. Various Arab and Berber tribes fought each other for varying degrees of power some cities tried to break away and form their own state and even members of Abd al-Rahman's family tried to wrest power from him. During a large revolt dissidents marched on Córdoba itself; However Abd al-Rahman always managed to stay one step ahead and crushed all opposition; as he always dealt severely with dissidence in al-Andalus. However this assumption needs to be in perspective since in 756 he was in charge of a limited number of southern strongholds and he faced resistance to submit from other towns during the next 25 years rather than revolts.

Despite all this turmoil in al-Andalus Abd al-Rahman wanted to take the fight back east to Baghdad. Revenge for the massacre of his family at the hands of the Abbasids must surely have been the driving factor in Abd al-Rahman's war plans. However his war against Baghdad was put on hold by more internal problems. The city of Zaragoza on the Upper March remained out of reach of the Umayyad leader since the times of Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri bidding for autonomy. Little could Abd al-Rahman have known that as he set off to settle matters in that northern city his hopes of warring against Baghdad would be indefinitely put on hold.

===Problems in the Upper March===
Zaragoza proved to be a most difficult city to reign over for not only Abd ar-Rahman but his successors as well. In the year 777–778 several notable men including Sulayman ibn Yokdan al-Arabi al-Kelbi the self-appointed governor of Zaragoza met with delegates of the leader of the Franks Charlemagne. ""(Charlemagne's) army was enlisted to help the Muslim governors of Barcelona and Zaragoza against the Umayyad (emir) in Cordoba...."" Essentially Charlemagne was being hired as a mercenary even though he likely had other plans of acquiring the area for his own empire. After Charlemagne's columns arrived at the gates of Zaragoza Sulayman got cold feet and refused to let the Franks into the city after his subordinate al-Husayn ibn Yahiya had successfully defeated and captured Abd al-Rahman's most trusted general Thalaba Ibn Ubayd. It is possible that he realized that Charlemagne would want to usurp power from him. After capturing Sulayman Charlemagne's force eventually headed back to France via a narrow pass in the Pyrenees where his rearguard was wiped out by Basque and Gascon rebels (this disaster inspired the epic Chanson de Roland). Charlemagne also suffered attack from Sulayman's relatives who had freed Sulayman.

Now Abd al-Rahman could deal with Sulayman and the city of Zaragoza without having to fight a massive Christian army. In 779 Abd al-Rahman offered Husayn one of Sulayman's allies the job of Zaragoza's governorship. The temptation was too much for al-Husayn who murdered his colleague Sulayman. As promised al-Husayn was awarded Zaragoza with the expectation that he would always be a subordinate of Córdoba. However within two years al-Husayn broke off relations with Abd al-Rahman and announced that Zaragoza would be an independent city-state. Once again Abd al-Rahman had to be concerned with developments in the Upper March. He was intent on keeping this important northern border city within the Umayyad fold. By 783 Abd al-Rahman's army advanced on Zaragoza.  It appeared as though Abd al-Rahman wanted to make clear to this troublesome city that independence was out of the question. Included in the arsenal of Abd al-Rahman's army were thirty-six siege engines. Zaragoza's famous white granite defensive walls were breached under a torrent of ordnance from the Umayyad lines. Abd al-Rahman's warriors spilled into the city's streets quickly thwarting al-Husayn's desires for independence.

===Military and social and constructions works===
After the aforementioned period of conflict Abd al-Rahman continued in his improvement of al-Andalus' infrastructure. He ensured roadways were begun aqueducts were constructed or improved and that a new mosque was well funded in his capital at Córdoba. Construction on what would in time become the world-famous Great Mosque of Córdoba was started circa the year 786. Abd al-Rahman knew that one of his sons would one day inherit the rule of al-Andalus but that it was a land torn by strife. In order to successfully rule in such a situation Abd al-Rahman needed to create a reliable civil service and organize a standing army. He felt that he could not always rely on the local populace in providing a loyal army; and therefore bought a massive standing army consisting mainly of Berbers from North Africa as well as slaves from other areas. The total number of army-men under his command were nearly 40000. As was common during the years of Islamic expansion from Arabia religious tolerance was practiced. Abd al-Rahman continued to allow Jews and Christians and other monotheistic religions to retain and practice their faiths. They didand have to pay a tribute tax for this privilege. Abd al-Rahman's policy of taxing non-Muslims which was often carried out by later rulers changed the religious dynamic of al-Andalus. Possibly because of excessive tribute taxes ""the bulk of the country's population must have become Muslim"". However other scholars have argued that though 80% of al-Andalus converted to Islam it did not truly occur until near the 10th century.

Christians more often converted to Islam than Jews although there were converted Jews among the new followers of Islam. There was a great deal of freedom of interaction between the groups: for example Sarah the granddaughter of the Visigoth king Wittiza married a Muslim man and bore two sons who were later counted among the ranks of the highest Arab nobility.

Abd al-Rahman I was able to forge a new Umayyad dynasty by standing successfully against Charlemagne the Abassids the Berbers and other Muslim Spaniards. There is some disputeAmong whom? as to what exactly it was that he created: an extension of the Umayyad Dynasty or the new Caliphate of Cordoba.

===Death===
The date of Abd al-Rahman's death is disputed but is generally accepted to be sometime around 785 through 788. Abd al-Rahman died in his adopted city of Córdoba and was supposedly buried under the site of the Mezquita. Abd al-Rahman's alleged favorite son was his choice for successor and would later be known as Hisham I. Abd ar-Rahman's progeny would continue to rule al-Andalus in the name of the house of Umayyad for several generations with the zenith of their power coming during the reign of Abd al-Rahman III.

905,Apple II,Overview,"In the May 1977 issue of ''Byte'' Steve Wozniak published a detailed description of his design; the article began ""To me a personal computer should be small reliable convenient to use and inexpensive"".

The Apple II used a multiplicity of idiosyncratic engineering shortcuts to save hardware and reduce costs. For example: 
*Taking advantage of the way that 6502 processor only accesses memory on alternate phases of the clock cycle the video generation circuitry's memory access on the otherwise unused phase avoids memory contention issues and interruptions of the video stream. 
*This arrangement simultaneously eliminated the need for a separate refresh circuit for the DRAM chips as the video transfer accessed each row of the dynamic memory within the timeout period. 
*Rather than use a complex analog-to-digital circuit to read the outputs of the game controller Wozniak used a simple timer circuit whose period is proportional to the resistance of the game controller and used a software loop to measure the timer.
*A single 7 MHz master oscillator was divided by various ratios to produce all other required frequencies including the microprocessor clock signals the video transfer counters and the color-burst samples.

The text and graphics screens have a complex arrangement (the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory) which is reputedly due to Wozniak's realization that doing it that way would allow for the refresh of the dynamic RAM as a side effect as described above; it had no cost overhead to have software calculate or look up the address of the required scanline and avoided the need for significant extra hardware. Similarly in the high-resolution graphics mode color is determined by pixel position and can thus be implemented in software saving Wozniak the chips needed to convert bit patterns to colors. This also allows for subpixel font rendering since orange and blue pixels appear half a pixel-width farther to the right on the screen than green and purple pixels.

The Apple II at first used data cassette storage like most other microcomputers of the time. In 1978 the company introduced an external -inch floppy disk drive the Disk II attached via a controller card that plugs into one of the computer's expansion slots (usually slot 6). The Disk II interface created by Wozniak is regarded as an engineering masterpiece for its economy of electronic components.

The approach taken in the Disk II controller is typical of Wozniak's designs. With a few small-scale logic chips and a cheap PROM (programmable read-only memory) he created a functional floppy-disk interface at a fraction of the component cost of standard circuit configurations.

===Innovation of integrated User Interface===
With the Apple I and the Apple II Wozniak introduced an entirely novel configuration of the microcomputer concept which was immediately adopted as the industry standard and remains taken for granted to this day—namely the integration of the standard input and output devices (the typewriter-style keyboard and the video display screen) into the computer itself. Until that time microcomputer devices either had an extremely limited I/O capability—such as perhaps a hex keypad and a 16- or 32-character display or no built-in user interface at all following the convention of mainframe and minicomputers in requiring the connection of an external teleprinter unit or visual display terminal to complete a usable system. The cost of such terminals could easily exceed the price of the computer itself. Wozniak's inclusion of an RF output which could connect to the aerial socket of a standard domestic television set enabled users to acquire a complete system without incurring the cost of a video monitor.

731,Unit of alcohol,Recommended maximum,"

From 1992 to 1995 the UK government advised that men should drink no more than 21 units per week and women no more than 14. (The difference between the sexes was due to the typically lower weight and water-to-body-mass ratio of women.)  The Times reported in October 2007 that these limits had been ""plucked out of the air"" and had no scientific basis.

This was changed after a government study showed that many people were in effect ""saving up"" their units and using them at the end of the week a phenomenon referred to as binge drinking. Since 1995 the advice was that regular consumption of 3–4 units a day for men or 2–3 units a day for women would not pose significant health risks but that consistently drinking four or more units a day (men) or three or more units a day (women) is not advisable.

An international study of about 6000 men and 11000 women for a total of 75000 person-years found that people who reported that they drank more than a threshold value of 2 units of alcohol a day had a higher risk of fractures than non-drinkers. For example those who drank over 3 units a day had nearly twice the risk of a hip fracture.

969,Albrecht Dürer,Nuremberg and the masterworks (1507–1520),"''Adam and Eve'' {1504}
Adam and Eve'' (1507)

Despite the regard in which he was held by the Venetians Dürer returned to Nuremberg by mid-1507 remaining in Germany until 1520. His reputation had spread throughout Europe and he was on friendly terms and in communication with most of the major artists including Raphael Giovanni Bellini and—mainly through Lorenzo di Credi—Leonardo da Vinci.

Between 1507 and 1511 Dürer worked on some of his most celebrated paintings: ''Adam and Eve'' (1507) ''The Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand'' (1508 for Frederick of Saxony) ''Virgin with the Iris'' (1508) the altarpiece ''Assumption of the Virgin'' (1509 for Jacob Heller of Frankfurt) and ''Adoration of the Trinity'' (1511 for Matthaeus Landauer). During this period he also completed two woodcut series the Great Passion and the Life of the Virgin both published in 1511 together with a second edition of the Apocalypse series. The post-Venetian woodcuts show Dürer's development of chiaroscuro modelling effects creating a mid-tone throughout the print to which the highlights and shadows can be contrasted.

Other works from this period include the thirty-seven woodcut subjects of the Little Passion published first in 1511 and a set of fifteen small engravings on the same theme in 1512. Indeed complaining that painting did not make enough money to justify the time spent when compared to his prints he produced no paintings from 1513 to 1516. However in 1513 and 1514 Dürer created his three most famous engravings: ''Knight Death and the Devil'' (1513 probably based on Erasmus's treatise ''Enchiridion militis Christiani'') ''St. Jerome in his Study'' and the much-debated ''Melencolia I'' (both 1514). Further outstanding pen and ink drawings of Dürer´s period of art work of 1513 were drafts for his friend Willibald Prickheimer. These drafts were later used to design the famous chandeliers lusterweibchen.

In 1515 he created his ''woodcut of a Rhinoceros'' which had arrived in Lisbon from a written description and sketch by another artist without ever seeing the animal himself. An image of the Indian rhinoceros the image has such force that it remains one of his best-known and was still used in some German school science text-books as late as last century. In the years leading to 1520 he produced a wide range of works including the woodblocks for the first western printed star charts in 1515 and portraits in tempera on linen in 1516.

===Patronage of Maximilian I===
''Portrait of Maximilian I''

From 1512 Maximilian I became Dürer's major patron. His commissions included ''The Triumphal Arch'' a vast work printed from 192 separate blocks the symbolism of which is partly informed by Pirckheimer's translation of Horapollo's ''Hieroglyphica''. The design program and explanations were devised by Johannes Stabius the architectural design by the master builder and court-painter Jörg Kölderer and the woodcutting itself by Hieronymous Andreae with Dürer as designer-in-chief. ''The Arch'' was followed by ''The Triumphal Procession'' the program of which was worked out in 1512 by Marx Treitz-Saurwein and includes woodcuts by Albrecht Altdorfer and Hans Springinklee as well as Dürer.

Dürer worked with pen on the marginal images for an edition of the Emperor's printed Prayer-Book; these were quite unknown until facsimiles were published in 1808 as part of the first book published in lithography. Dürer's work on the book was halted for an unknown reason and the decoration was continued by artists including Lucas Cranach the Elder and Hans Baldung. Dürer also made several portraits of the Emperor including one shortly before Maximilian's death in 1519.

30,Austroasiatic languages,Proto-language,"

Much work has been done on the reconstruction of Proto-Mon–Khmer in Harry L. Shorto's ''Mon–Khmer Comparative Dictionary''. Little work has been done on the Munda languages which are not well documented. With their demotion from a primary branch Proto-Mon–Khmer becomes synonymous with Proto-Austroasiatic.

Paul Sidwell (2005) reconstructs the consonant inventory of Proto-Mon–Khmer as follows:

This is identical to earlier reconstructions except for .   is better preserved in the Katuic languages which Sidwell has specialized in. Sidwell (2011) suggests that the likely homeland of Austroasiatic is the middle Mekong in the area of the Bahnaric and Katuic languages (approximately where modern Laos Thailand and Cambodia come together) and that the family is not as old as frequently assumed dating to perhaps 2000 BCE.

407,Amine,Synthesis,"

===Alkylation===
The most industrially significant amines are prepared from ammonia by alkylation with alcohols:
:ROH + NH3 → RNH2 + H2O
These reactions require catalysts specialized apparatus and additional purification measures since the selectivity can be problematic. The same amines can be prepared by treatment of haloalkanes with ammonia and amines:
:RX + 2 R′NH2 → RR′NH + RR′NH2X
Such reactions which are most useful for alkyl iodides and bromides are rarely employed because the degree of alkylation is difficult to control. Selectivity can be improved via the Delépine reaction although this is rarely employed on an industrial scale.

===Reductive routes===
Via the process of hydrogenation nitriles are reduced to amines using hydrogen in the presence of a nickel catalyst. Reactions are sensitive to acidic or alkaline conditions which can cause hydrolysis of the –CN group. LiAlH4 is more commonly employed for the reduction of nitriles on the laboratory scale. Similarly LiAlH4 reduces amides to amines. Many amines are produced from aldehydes and ketones via reductive amination which can either proceed catalytically or stoichiometrically.

Aniline (C6H5NH2) and its derivatives are prepared by reduction of the nitroaromatics. In industry hydrogen is the preferred reductant whereas in the laboratory tin and iron are often employed.

===Specialized methods===
Many laboratory methods exist for the preparation of amines many of these methods being rather specialized.

736,Adobe Systems,History,"
The company was started in John Warnock's garage. The name of the company ''Adobe'' comes from Adobe Creek in Los Altos California which ran behind Warnock's house. Adobe's corporate logo features a stylized ""A"" and was designed by the wife of John Warnock Marva Warnock who is a graphic designer.

Steve Jobs asked to buy the company for five million dollars in 1982 but Warnock and Geschke refused. Their investors urged them to work something out with Jobs so they agreed to sell him shares worth 19 percent of the company for which Jobs paid a five-times multiple of their company's valuation at the time plus a five-year license fee for PostScript in advance. The purchase and advance made Adobe the first company in the history of Silicon Valley to become profitable in its first year.

Warnock and Geschke considered various business options including a copy-service business and a turnkey system for office printing. Then they chose to focus on developing specialized printing software and created the Adobe PostScript page description language.

PostScript was the first truly international standard for computer printing as it included algorithms describing the letter-forms of many languages. Adobe added kanji printer products in 1988. Warnock and Geschke were also able to bolster the credibility of Postscript by connecting with a typesetting manufacturer. They weren't able to work with Compugraphic but then worked with Linotype to license the Helvetica and Times Roman fonts (through the Linotron 100). By 1987 PostScript had become the industry-standard printer language with more than 400 third-party software programs and licensing agreements with 19 printer companies.

Warnock described the language as ""extensible"" in its ability to apply graphic arts standards to office printing.

Adobe's first products after PostScript were digital fonts which they released in a proprietary format called Type 1. Apple subsequently developed a competing standard TrueType which provided full scalability and precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font's outlines and licensed it to Microsoft.

In the mid-1980s Adobe entered the consumer software market with Illustrator a vector-based drawing program for the Apple Macintosh. Illustrator which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers.

Adobe Systems entered NASDAQ in August 1986. Its revenue has grown from roughly $1 billion in 1999 to roughly $4 billion in 2012. Adobe's fiscal years run from December to November.  For example the 2007 fiscal year ended on November 30 2007.

In 1989 Adobe introduced what was to become its flagship product a graphics editing program for the Macintosh called Photoshop. Stable and full-featured Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.

In 1993 Adobe introduced PDF the Portable Document Format and its Adobe Acrobat and Reader software. PDF is now an International Standard: ISO 32000-1:2008.

In December 1991 Adobe released Adobe Premiere which Adobe rebranded as Adobe Premiere Pro in 2003. In 1992 Adobe acquired OCR Systems Inc. In 1994 Adobe acquired Aldus and added PageMaker and After Effects to its product line later in the year; it also controls the TIFF file format. In 1995 Adobe added FrameMaker the long-document DTP application to its product line after Adobe acquired Frame Technology Corp. In 1996 Adobe Systems Inc added Ares Software Corp. In 2002 Adobe acquired Canadian company Accelio (also known as JetForm).
Adobe Systems Canada in Ottawa Ontario (not far from archrival Corel).On December 12 2005 Adobe acquired its main rival Macromedia in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion adding ColdFusion Contribute Captivate Acrobat Connect (formerly Macromedia Breeze) Director Dreamweaver Fireworks Flash FlashPaper Flex FreeHand HomeSite JRun Presenter and Authorware to Adobe's product line.

Adobe released Adobe Media Player in April 2008. On April 27 Adobe discontinued development and sales of its older HTML/web development software GoLive in favor of Dreamweaver. Adobe offered a discount on Dreamweaver for GoLive users and supports those who still use GoLive with online tutorials and migration assistance. On June 1 Adobe launched Acrobat.com a series of web applications geared for collaborative work. Creative Suite 4 which includes Design Web Production Premium and Master Collection came out in October 2008 in six configurations at prices from about USD $1700 to $2500 or by individual application. The Windows version of Photoshop includes 64-bit processing. On December 3 2008 Adobe laid off 600 of its employees (8% of the worldwide staff) citing the weak economic environment.

On November 10 2009 the company laid off a further 680 employees. Adobe announced it was investigating a ""coordinated attack"" against corporate network systems in China managed by the company.

Adobe's 2010 was marked by continuing front-and-back arguments with Apple over the latter's non-support for Adobe Flash on its iPhone iPad and other products. Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs claimed that Flash was not reliable or secure enough while Adobe executives have argued that Apple wish to maintain control over the iOS platform. In April 2010 Steve Jobs published a post titled ""Thoughts on Flash"" where he outlined his thoughts on Flash and the rise of HTML 5.
In July 2010 Adobe bought Day Software integrating their line of CQ Products: WCM DAM SOCO and Mobile

In January 2011 Adobe acquired DemDex Inc. with the intent of adding DemDex's audience-optimization software to its online marketing suite. At Photoshop World 2011 Adobe unveiled a new mobile photo service. Carousel is a new  application for iPhone iPad and Mac that uses Photoshop Lightroom technology for users to adjust and fine-tune images on all platforms. Carousel will also allow users to automatically sync share and browse photos. The service was later renamed to ""Adobe Revel"".

In October 2011 Adobe acquired Nitobi Software the makers of the mobile application development framework ''PhoneGap''. As part of the acquisition the source code of PhoneGap was submitted to the Apache Foundation where it became Apache Cordova.

On November 9 2011 Adobe announced that they would cease development of Flash for mobile devices following version 11.1. Instead it would focus on HTML 5 for mobile devices. On December 1 2011 Adobe announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held Efficient Frontier.

In December 2012 Adobe opened a new 280000 square foot corporate campus in Lehi Utah.


In 2013 Adobe Systems endured a major security breach. Vast portions of the source code for the company's software were stolen and posted online and over 150 million records of Adobe's customers have been made readily available for download. In 2012 about 40 million sets of payment card information were compromised by a hack of Adobe.

A class-action lawsuit alleging that the company suppressed employee compensation was filed against Adobe and three other Silicon Valley-based companies in a California federal district court in 2013. In May 2014 it was revealed the four companies Adobe Apple Google and Intel had reached agreement with the plaintiffs 64000 employees of the four companies to pay a sum of $324.5 million to settle the suit.

The earliest certain ancestor of ""A"" is aleph (also written 'aleph) the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet which consisted entirely of consonants (for that reason it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet). In turn the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto-Sinaitic script influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphs styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.

In 1600 B.C.E. the Phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. Its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the Hebrew or Arabic aleph.

When the ancient Greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stop—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in Phoenician and other Semitic languages and that was the first phoneme of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel  and called it by the similar name of alpha. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the Greek Dark Ages dating to the 8th century BC the letter rests upon its side but in the Greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

The Etruscans brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the Italian Peninsula and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the Etruscan alphabet to write the Latin language and the resulting letter was preserved in the Latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages including English.

===Typographic variants===
Different glyphs of the lowercase letter A.
During Roman times there were many variant forms of the letter ""A"". First was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other ""permanent"" mediums. There was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the ""perishable"" nature of these surfaces there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive such as majuscule cursive minuscule cursive and semicursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants include the early semi-uncial the uncial and the later semi-uncial.

Typographic variants include a double-storey '''a''' and single-storey '''ɑ'''.At the end of the Roman Empire (5th century AD) several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive minuscule of Italy the Merovingian script in France the Visigothic script in Spain and the Insular or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain. By the 9th century the Caroline script which was very similar to the present-day form was the principal form used in book-making before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.

15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. These variants the ''Italic'' and ''Roman'' forms were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italic form also called ''script a'' is used in most current handwriting and consists of a circle and vertical stroke. This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter tau in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers. The Roman form is used in most printed material; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it (""a""). Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form.

Italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest (set in Roman type). There are some other cases aside from italic type where ''script a'' (""ɑ"") also called Latin alpha is used in contrast with Latin ""a"" (such as in the International Phonetic Alphabet).

139,Anatolia,Definition,"
The location of Turkey (within the rectangle) in reference to the European continent. Anatolia roughly corresponds to the Asian part of Turkey except the eastern parts historically known as the Armenian Highlands
East Aegean Islands and the island of Cyprus to Anatolia's continental shelf.

The Anatolian peninsula also called Asia Minor  is bounded by the Black Sea to the north the Mediterranean Sea to the south the Aegean Sea to the west and the Sea of Marmara to the northwest which separates Anatolia from Thrace in Europe.

Traditionally Anatolia is considered to extend in the east to an indefinite line running from the Gulf of Alexandretta to the Black Sea coterminous with the Anatolian Plateau. This traditional geographical definition is used for example in the latest edition of ''Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary'' as well as the archeological community. Under this definition Anatolia is bounded to the east by the Armenian Highlands and the Euphrates before that river bends to the southeast to enter Mesopotamia. To the southeast it is bounded by the ranges that separate it from the Orontes valley in Syria (region) and the Mesopotamian plain.

Following the Armenian Genocide and establishment of the Republic of Turkey the Armenian Highlands (or Western Armenia) were renamed ""Eastern Anatolia"" (literally ''The Eastern East'') by the Turkish government being effectively co-terminous with Asian Turkey. Turkey's First Geography Congress in 1941 created two regions to the east of the Gulf of Iskenderun-Black Sea line named the Eastern Anatolia Region and the Southeastern Anatolia Region the former largely corresponding to the western part of the Armenian Highland the latter to the northern part of the Mesopotamian plain. This wider definition of Anatolia has gained widespread currency outside of Turkey and has for instance been adopted by ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' and other encyclopedic and general reference publications. Davidian terms the expanded use of ""Anatolia"" to apply to territory formerly referred to as Armenia as ""an historical imposition"" and notes that a growing body of literature is uncomfortable with referring to the Ottoman East as ""Eastern Anatolia""

1021,Artillery,Introduction,"



French naval piece of the late 19th century
'''Artillery''' is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications and led to heavy fairly immobile siege engines. As technology improved lighter more mobile field artillery developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total firepower.

In its earliest sense the word artillery referred to any group of soldiers primarily armed with some form of manufactured weapon or armour. Since the introduction of gunpowder and cannon the word ""artillery"" has largely meant cannon and in contemporary usage it usually refers to shell-firing guns howitzers mortars rockets and guided missiles. In common speech the word artillery is often used to refer to individual devices along with their accessories and fittings although these assemblages are more properly called ""equipments"". However there is no generally recognised generic term for a gun howitzer mortar and so forth: the United States uses ""artillery piece"" but most English-speaking armies use ""gun"" and ""mortar"". The projectiles fired are typically either ""shot"" (if solid) or ""shell"" (if not). ""Shell"" is a widely used generic term for a projectile which is a component of munitions.

By association artillery may also refer to the arm of service that customarily operates such engines.  In some armies one arm has operated field coast anti-aircraft artillery and some anti-tank artillery in others these have been separate arms and in some nations coast has been a naval or marine responsibility. In the 20th Century technology based target acquisition devices such as radar and systems such as sound ranging and flash spotting emerged to acquire targets primarily for artillery.  These are usually operated by one or more of the artillery arms.  The widespread adoption of indirect fire in the early 20th century introduced the need for specialist data for field artillery notably survey and meteorological in some armies provision of these are the responsibility of the artillery arm.

Artillery originated for use against ground targets—against infantry cavalry and other artillery.  An early specialist development was coastal artillery for use against enemy ships.  The early 20th Century saw the development of a new class of artillery for use against aircraft: anti-aircraft guns.

Artillery is arguably the most lethal form of land-based armament currently employed and has been since at least the early Industrial Revolution. The majority of combat deaths in the Napoleonic Wars World War I and World War II were caused by artillery. In 1944 Joseph Stalin said in a speech that artillery was ""the God of War"".

509,Alexander of Pherae,Death,"The murder of Alexander is assigned by Diodorus to 357/356 BC.  Plutarch gives a detailed account of it with a lively picture of the palace.  Guards watched throughout the night except at Alexander's bedchamber which was at the top of a ladder with a ferocious chained dog guarding the door.  Thebe Alexander's wife and cousin (or half-sister as the daughter of Jason of Pherae) concealed her three brothers in the house during the day had the dog removed when Alexander had gone to rest and having covered the steps of the ladder with wool brought up the young men to her husband's chamber.  Though she had taken away Alexander's sword they feared to set about the deed until she threatened to wake him.  Her brothers then entered and killed Alexander.  His body was cast into the streets and exposed to every indignity.

Of Thebe's motive for the murder different accounts are given.  Plutarch states it to have been fear of her husband together with hatred of his cruel and brutal character and ascribes these feelings principally to the representations of Pelopidas when she visited him in his prison.  In Cicero the deed is ascribed to jealousy.  Other accounts have it that Alexander had taken Thebe's youngest brother as his eromenos and tied him up.  Exasperated by his wife's pleas to release the youth he murdered the boy which drove her to revenge.

535,Andrew Johnson,Post-presidency,"Senator Andrew Johnson in 1875 (age 66)

After leaving the presidency Johnson remained for some weeks in Washington then returned to Greeneville for the first time in eight years. He was honored with large public celebrations along the way especially in Tennessee where cities hostile to him during the war hung out welcome banners. He had arranged to purchase a large farm near Greeneville to live on after his presidency.

Some expected Johnson to seek to be Tennessee's governor again or to attempt a return to the Senate others that he would become a railroad executive. Johnson found Greeneville boring and his private life was embittered by the suicide of his son Robert in 1869. Seeking vindication for himself and revenge against his political enemies he launched a Senate bid soon after returning home. Tennessee had gone Republican but court rulings restoring the vote to some whites and the violence of the Ku Klux Klan kept down the African-American vote leading to a Democratic victory in the legislative elections in August 1869. Johnson was seen as a likely victor in the Senate election although hated by Radical Republicans and also by some Democrats because of his wartime activities. Although he was at one point within a single vote of victory in the legislature's balloting the Republicans eventually elected Henry Cooper over Johnson 54–51. In 1872 there was a special election for an at-large congressional seat for Tennessee; Johnson initially sought the Democratic nomination but when he saw that it would go to former Confederate general Benjamin F. Cheatham decided to run as an independent. The former president was defeated finishing third but the split in the Democratic Party defeated Cheatham in favor of an old Johnson Unionist ally Horace Maynard.

In 1873 Johnson contracted cholera during an epidemic but recovered; that year he lost about $73000 when the First National Bank of Washington went under though he was eventually repaid much of the sum. He began looking towards the next Senate election to take place in the legislature in early 1875. Johnson began to woo the farmers' Grange movement; with his Jeffersonian leanings he easily gained their support. He spoke throughout the state in his final campaign tour. Few African Americans outside the large towns were now able to vote as Reconstruction faded in Tennessee setting a pattern that would be repeated in the other Southern states; the white domination would last almost a century. In the Tennessee legislative elections in August the Democrats elected 92 legislators to the Republicans' eight and Johnson went to Nashville for the legislative session. When the balloting for the Senate seat began on January 20 1875 he led with 30 votes but did not have the required majority as three former Confederate generals one former colonel and a former Democratic congressman split the vote with him. Johnson's opponents tried to agree on a single candidate who might gain majority support and defeat him but failed and he was elected on January 26 on the 54th ballot with a margin of a single vote. Nashville erupted in rejoicing; remarked Johnson ""Thank God for the vindication.""

Johnson's comeback garnered national attention with the ''St. Louis Republican'' calling it ""the most magnificent personal triumph which the history of American politics can show"". At his swearing-in in the Senate on March 5 1875 he was greeted with flowers and sworn in with his predecessor as vice president Hamlin by that office's current incumbent Henry Wilson who as senator had voted for his ousting. Many Republicans ignored Senator Johnson though some such as Ohio's John Sherman (who had voted for conviction) shook his hand. Johnson remains the only former president to serve in the Senate. He spoke only once in the short session on March 22 lambasting President Grant for his use of federal troops in support of Louisiana's Reconstruction government. The former president asked ""How far off is military despotism?"" and concluded his speech ""may God bless this people and God save the Constitution.""

===Death===

Johnson returned home after the special session concluded. In late July convinced some of his opponents were defaming him in the Ohio gubernatorial race he decided to travel there to give speeches. He began the trip on July 28 and broke the journey at his daughter Mary's farm near Elizabethton where his daughter Martha was also staying. That evening he suffered a stroke but refused medical treatment until the next day when he did not improve and two doctors were sent for from Elizabethton. He seemed to respond to their ministrations but suffered another stroke on the evening of July 30 and died early the following morning at the age of 66. President Grant had the ""painful duty"" of announcing the death of the only surviving past president. Northern newspapers in their obituaries tended to focus on Johnson's loyalty during the war while Southern ones paid tribute to his actions as president. Johnson's funeral was held on August 3 in Greeneville. He was buried with his body wrapped in an American flag and a copy of the U.S. Constitution placed under his head according to his wishes. The burial ground was dedicated as the Andrew Johnson National Cemetery in 1906 and with his home and tailor's shop is part of the Andrew Johnson National Historic Site.

895,Antonio Salieri,Life and career,"Salieri started his musical studies in his native town of Legnago; he was first taught at home by his older brother Francesco Salieri (a former student of the violinist and composer Giuseppe Tartini) and he received further lessons from the organist of the Legnago Cathedral Giuseppe Simoni a pupil of Padre Giovanni Battista Martini. Salieri would recall little from his childhood in later years except passions for sugar reading and music. He twice ran away from home without permission to hear his elder brother play violin concertos in neighboring churches on festival days (resulting in the loss of his beloved sugar) and he recounted being chastised by his father after failing to greet a local priest with proper respect. Salieri responded to the reprimand by saying the priest's organ playing displeased him because it was in an inappropriately theatrical style. Sometime between 1763 and 1764 Salieri suffered the deaths of both parents and was briefly taken in by an anonymous brother a monk in Padua and then for unknown reasons in 1765 or 1766 he became the ward of a Venetian nobleman named Giovanni Mocenigo (which Giovanni is at this time unknown) a member of the powerful and well connected Mocenigo family. It is possible that Antonio's father and Giovanni were friends or business associates but this is obscure. While living in Venice Salieri continued his musical studies with the organist and opera composer Giovanni Battista Pescetti then following Pescetti's sudden death he studied with the opera singer Ferdinando Pacini or Pasini. It was through Pacini that Salieri gained the attention of the composer Florian Leopold Gassmann who impressed with his protege's talents and concerned for the boy's future took the young orphan to Vienna where he personally directed and paid for the remainder of Salieri's musical education.

Salieri and Gassmann arrived in Vienna on 15 June 1766. Gassmann's first act was to take Salieri to the Italian Church to consecrate his teaching and service to God an event that left a deep impression on Salieri for the rest of his life. Salieri's education included instruction in Latin and Italian poetry by Fr. Don Pietro Tommasi instruction in the German language and European literature. His music studies revolved around vocal composition and thoroughbass. His musical theory training in harmony and counterpoint was rooted in Johann Fux's Gradus ad Parnassum which Salieri translated during each Latin lesson. As a result Salieri continued to live with Gassmann even after Gassmann's marriage an arrangement that lasted until the year of Gassmann's death and Salieri's own marriage in 1774. Few of Salieri's compositions have survived from this early period. In his old age Salieri hinted that these works were either purposely destroyed or had been lost with the exception of a few works for the church. Among these sacred works there survives a Mass in C major written without a ""Gloria"" and in the antique a cappella style (presumably for one of the church's penitential seasons) and dated 2 August 1767. A complete opera composed in 1769 (presumably as a culminating study) ''La vestale'' (''The Vestal Virgin'') has also been lost.

Beginning in 1766 Gassmann introduced Salieri to the daily chamber music performances held during Emperor Joseph II's evening meal. Salieri quickly impressed the Emperor and Gassmann was instructed to bring his pupil as often as he wished. This was the beginning of a relationship between monarch and musician that would last until Joseph's death in 1790. Salieri met Pietro Antonio Domenico Trapassi better known as Metastasio and Christoph Willibald Gluck during this period at the famous Sunday morning salons held at the home of the Martinez family. Here Metastasio had an apartment and participated in the weekly gatherings. Over the next several years Metastasio gave Salieri informal instruction in prosody and the declamation of Italian poetry and Gluck became an informal advisor friend and confidante. It was toward the end of this extended period of study that Gassmann was called away on a new opera commission and a gap in the theater's program allowed for Salieri to make his debut as a composer of a completely original opera buffa. Salieri's first full opera was composed during the winter and carnival season of 1770; ''Le donne letterate'' and was based on Molière's ''Les Femmes Savantes'' (''The Learned Ladies'') with a libretto by Giovanni Gastone Boccherini a dancer in the court ballet and a brother of the famous composer Luigi Boccherini. The modest success of this opera would launch Salieri's 34-year operatic career as a composer of over 35 original dramas.

===Early Viennese period and operas (1770–1778)===
Following the modest success of ''Le donne letterate'' Salieri received new commissions writing two additional operas in 1770 both with libretti by Boccherini. The first a pastoral opera ''L'amore innocente'' (''Innocent Love'') was a light hearted comedy set in the Austrian mountains and the second was based on an episode from Cervantes ''Don Quixote'' – ''Don Chisciotte alle nozze di Gamace'' (''Don Quixote at the Marriage of Camacho''). In these first works drawn mostly from the traditions of mid-century opera buffa Salieri showed a penchant for experimentation and for mixing the established characteristics of specific operatic genres. Don Chisciotte was a mix of ballet and opera buffa and the lead female roles in ''L'amore innocente'' were designed to contrast and highlight the different traditions of operatic writing for soprano even borrowing stylistic flourishes from opera-seria in the use of coloratura in what was a short pastoral comedy more in keeping with a Roman Intermezzo. The mixing and pushing against the boundaries of established operatic genres would be a continuing hallmark of Salieri's own personal style and in his choice of material for the plot (as in his first opera) he manifested a lifelong interest in subjects drawn from classic drama and literature.

Salieri's first great success was in the realm of serious opera. Commissioned for an unknown occasion Salieri's ''Armida'' was based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem ''La Gerusalemme liberata'' (''Jerusalem Delivered'') and premiered on 2 June 1771. ''Armida'' is a tale of love and duty in conflict and is saturated in magic. The opera is set during the First Crusade and it features a dramatic mix of ballet aria ensemble and choral writing combining theatricality scenic splendor and high emotionalism. The work clearly followed in Gluck's footsteps and embraced his reform of serious opera begun with ''Orfeo ed Euridice'' and ''Alceste''. The libretto to ''Armida'' was by Marco Coltellini the house poet for the imperial theaters. While Salieri followed the precepts set forth by Gluck and his librettist Ranieri de' Calzabigi in the preface to ''Alceste''; Salieri also drew on some musical ideas from the more traditional opera-seria and even opera buffa creating a new synthesis in the process. ''Armida'' was translated into German and widely performed especially in the northern German states where it helped to establish Salieri's reputation as an important and innovative modern composer It would also be the first opera to receive a serious preparation in a piano and vocal reduction by Carl Friedrich Cramer in 1783.

''Armida'' was soon followed by Salieri's first truly popular success; a commedia per musica in the style of Carlo Goldoni ''La fiera di Venezia'' (''The Fair of Venice''). ''La fiera'' was written for Carnival in 1772 and premiered on 29 January. Here Salieri returned to his collaboration with the young Boccherini who crafted an original plot. ''La fiera'' would feature characters singing in three languages a bustling portrayal of the Ascension-tide Fair and Carnival in Venice and large and lengthy ensembles and choruses. It also included an innovative scene that would combine a series of on stage dances with singing from both solo protagonists and the chorus. A pattern to be imitated by later composers most famously and successfully by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in ''Don Giovanni''. Salieri would also write several bravura arias for a soprano playing the part of a middle class character that would combine coloratura and concertante woodwind solos another innovation for a comic opera that was to be widely imitated.

Salieri's next two operas were not particular or lasting successes of the two only ''La secchia rapita'' (''The Stolen Bucket'') deserves mention. A parody of Metastasian opera-seria it featured dazzling parodies of the high flown and emotive arias found in that genre as well as bold and innovative orchestrations including the first known use of three tympani. Again a classic of Renaissance literature was the basis of the libretto by Boccherini in this case a comic mock-epic by Tassoni in which a war between Modena and Bologna ensues over a stolen bucket. This uneven work was followed by another popular comedic success ''La locandiera'' (''Mine Hostess'') an adaptation of the classic and popular spoken stage comedy ''La locandiera'' by Carlo Goldoni the libretto was prepared by Domenico Poggi.

The majority of Salieri's modest number of instrumental works also date from this time. Salieri's instrumental works have been judged by various critics and scholars  to lack the inspiration and innovation found in his writing for the stage. These orchestral works are mainly in the galant style and although they show some development toward the late classical they reflect a general weakness in comparison to his operatic works of the same and later periods. These works were written for mostly unknown occasions and artists. They include two concertos for pianoforte one in C major and one in B flat major (both 1773); a concerto for organ in C Major in two movements (the middle movement is missing from the autograph score or perhaps it was an improvised organ solo) (also 1773); two concertante works: a concerto for oboe violin and cello in D major (1770) and a flute and oboe concerto in C major (1774). These works are among the most frequently recorded of Salieri's compositions.

Upon Gassmann's death on 21 January most likely due to complications from an accident with a carriage some years earlier Salieri succeeded him as assistant director of the Italian opera in early 1774. In 1775 Salieri married Therese Helferstorfer on 10 October she was the daughter of a recently deceased financier and official of the court treasury. Sacred music was not a high priority for the composer during this stage of his career but he did compose an Alleluia for chorus and orchestra in 1774.

During the next three years Salieri was primarily concerned with rehearsing and conducting the Italian opera company in Vienna and teaching. His three complete operas written during this time show the development of his compositional skills but included no great success either commercially or artistically. His most important compositions during this period were a symphony in D major performed in the summer of 1776 and the oratorio ''La passione di Gesù Cristo'' with a text by Metastasio performed during Advent of 1776.

After the financial collapse of the Italian opera company in 1777 due to financial mis-management Joseph II decided to end the performance of Italian opera French spoken drama and ballet. Instead the two court-owned theaters would be reopened under new management and partly subsidized by the Imperial Court as a new National Theater. The re-launched theaters would promote German language plays and musical productions that reflected Austrian (or as Joseph II would have said) German values traditions and outlook. The Italian opera buffa company was therefore replaced by a German language Singspiel troupe. For Joseph and his supports of Imperial reform besides encouraging any first buddings of pan-national pride that would unite his multi-lingual and ethnic subjects under one common language; they also hoped to save a considerable amount of money in the process. Beginning in 1778 Emperor wished to have new works in German composed by his own subjects and brought on the stage with clear Imperial support. This in effect left Salieri's role as assistant court composer in a much reduced position. Salieri also had never truly mastered the German language and he now felt no longer competent to continue as assistant opera director. A further blow to his career was landed when the spoken drama and musical Singspiel were placed on an equal footing. For the young composer there would be few if any new compositional commissions to receive from the court. Salieri was left with few financial options and he began casting about for new opportunities.

===Italian tour (1778–1780)===
However in 1778 Gluck turned down an offer to compose the inaugural opera for La Scala in Milan; upon the suggestion of Joseph II and with the approval of Gluck Salieri was offered the commission which he gratefully accepted. Joseph II granted Salieri permission to take a year-long leave of absence (later extended) thus enabling him to write for La Scala and to undertake a tour of Italy. Salieri's Italian tour of 1778–80 began with the production of ''Europa riconosciuta'' (''Europa Recognized'') for La Scala (which was revived in 2004 for the same opera house's re-opening following extensive renovations). From Milan Salieri included stops in Venice and Rome and finally a return to Milan. During this tour he wrote three new comic operas and he also collaborated with Giacomo Rust on one opera ''Il Talismano'' (''The Talisman''). Of his Italian works one ''La scuola de' gelosi'' (''The School for Jealousy'') a witty study of amorous intrigue and emotion would prove a popular and lasting international success.

===Middle Viennese period and Parisian operas (1780–1788)===
Upon his return at imperial behest to Vienna in 1780 he wrote one German singspiel ''Der Rauchfangkehrer'' (''The Chimney Sweep'') which premiered in 1781. Salieri's ''Chimney Sweep'' and Mozart's work for the same company in 1782 ''Die Entführung aus dem Serail'' (''The Abduction from the Seraglio'') would be the only two major successes to emerge from the German singspiel experiment and only Mozart's opera would survive on the stage beyond the close of the 18th century. In 1783 the Italian opera company was revived with singers partly chosen and vetted by Salieri during his Italian tour the new season would open with a slightly re-worked version of Salieri's recent success ''La scuola de' gelosi''. Salieri then returned to his rounds of rehearsing composition and teaching. However his time at home in Vienna would be quickly brought to a close when an opportunity to write an opera for Paris arose again through the patronage of Gluck Salieri traveled abroad to fulfill an important commission.

The opera ''Les Danaïdes'' (''The Danaids'') is a five-act tragédie lyrique; the plot was based on an ancient Greek legend that had been the basis for the first play in a trilogy by Aeschylus entitled ''The Suppliants''. The original commission that reached Salieri in 1783–84 was to assist Gluck in finishing a work for Paris that had been all but completed; in reality Gluck had failed to notate any of the score for the new opera and gave the entire project over to his young friend. Gluck feared that the Parisian critics would denounce the opera by a young composer known mostly for comic pieces and so the opera was originally billed in the press as being a new work by Gluck with some assistance from Salieri then shortly before the premiere of the opera the Parisian press reported that the work was to be partly by Gluck and partly by Salieri and finally after popular and critical success were won on stage the opera was acknowledged in a letter to the public by Gluck as being wholly by the young Salieri. ''Les Danaïdes'' was received with great acclaim and its popularity with audiences and critics alike produced several further requests for new works for Paris audiences by Salieri. ''Les Danaïdes'' followed in the tradition of reform that Gluck had begun in the 1760s and that Salieri had emulated in his earlier opera ''Armida''. Salieri's first French opera contained scenes of great solemnity and festivity; yet overshadowing it all was darkness and revenge. The opera depicted politically motivated murder filial duty and love in conflict tyrannicide and finally eternal damnation. The opera with its dark overture lavish choral writing many ballet scenes and electrifying finale depicting a glimpse of hellish torture kept the opera on the stage in Paris for over forty years. A young Hector Berlioz recorded the deep impression this work made on him in his ''Mémoires''.

Upon returning to Vienna following his success in Paris Salieri met and befriended Lorenzo Da Ponte and had his first professional encounters with Mozart. Da Ponte would write his first opera libretto for Salieri ''Il ricco d'un giorno'' (''A Rich Man for a Day'') in 1784 it was not a success. Salieri next turned to Giambattista Casti as a librettist a more successful set of collaboration flowed from this pairing. In the mean time Da Ponte would begin work with Mozart on ''Le nozze di Figaro'' (''The Marriage of Figaro''). (For the famous relationship between Mozart and Salieri please see below.) Salieri soon produced one of his greatest works with the text by Casti ''La grotta di Trofonio'' (''The Cave of Trophonius'') in 1785 the first opera buffa published in full score by Artaria. Shortly after this success Joseph II had Mozart and Salieri each contribute a one-act opera and/or singspiel for production at a banquet in 1786. Salieri collaborated with Casti to produce a parody of the relationship between poet and composer in ''Prima la musica e poi le parole'' (''First the Music and then the Words''). This short work also highlighted the typical backstage antics of two high flown sopranos. Salieri then returned to Paris for the premiere of his tragédie lyrique ''Les Horaces'' (''The Horatii'') which proved a failure. However the failure of this work was more than made up for with his next Parisian opera ''Tarare'' with a libretto by Beaumarchais. This was intended to be the '''' of reform opera a completely new synthesis of poetry and music that was an 18th-century anticipation of the ideals of Richard Wagner. He also created a sacred cantata ''Le Jugement dernier'' (''The Last Judgement''). The success of his opera ''Tarare'' was such that it was soon translated into Italian at Joseph II's behest by Lorenzo Da Ponte as ''Axur Re d'Ormus'' (''Axur King of Hormuz'') and staged at the royal wedding of Franz II in 1788.

===Late Viennese operas (1788–1804)===
In 1788 Salieri returned to Vienna where he remained for the rest of his life. In that year he became Kapellmeister of the Imperial Chapel upon the death of Giuseppe Bonno; as Kapellmeister he conducted the music and musical school connected with the chapel until shortly before his death being officially retired from the post in 1824.

His Italian adaptation of ''Tarare'' ''Axur'' would prove to be his greatest international success. ''Axur'' was widely produced throughout Europe and it even reached South America with the exiled royal house of Portugal in 1824. ''Axur'' and his other new compositions completed by 1792 would mark the height of Salieri's popularity and his influence. Just as his apogee of fame was being reached abroad his influence in Vienna would begin to diminish with the death of Joseph II in 1790. Joseph's death deprived Salieri of his greatest patron and protector. During this period of imperial change in Vienna and revolutionary ferment in France Salieri composed two additional extremely innovative musical dramas to libretti by Giovanni Casti. Due however to their satiric and overtly liberal political inclinations both operas were seen as unsuitable for public performance in the politically reactive cultures of Leopold II and later Francis II. This resulted in two of his most original operas being consigned to his desk drawer namely ''Cublai gran kan de' Tartari'' (''Kublai Grand Kahn of Tartary'') a satire on the autocracy and court intrigues at the court of the Russian Czarina Catherine the Great and ''Catilina'' a semi-comic-semi-tragic account of the Catiline conspiracy that attempted to overthrow the Roman republic during the consulship of Cicero. These operas were composed in 1787 and 1792 respectively. Two other operas of little success and longterm importance were composed in 1789 and one great popular success ''La cifra'' (''The Cipher'').

As Salieri's political position became very insecure he was retired as director of the Italian opera in 1792. He continued to write new operas per imperial contract until 1804 when he voluntarily withdrew from the stage. The beginning of the opera ""Palmira regina di Persia"" by Antonio Salieri Of his late works for the stage only two works gained wide popular esteem during his life ''Palmira regina di Persia'' (''Palmira Queen of Persia'') 1795 and ''Cesare in Farmacusa'' (''Caesar on Pharmacusa'') both drawing on the heroic and exotic success established with ''Axur''. His late opera based on William Shakespeare's ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' ''Falstaff ossia Le tre burle'' (''Falstaff or the Three Tricks'') (1799) has found a wider audience in modern times than its original reception promised. His last opera was a German language singspiel ''Die Neger'' (''The Negroes'') a melodrama set in colonial Virginia with a text by Georg Friedrich Treitschke (the author of the libretto for Beethoven's ''Fidelio'') performed in 1804 and was a complete failure.

===Life after opera (1804–1825)===
When Salieri retired from the stage he recognized that artistic styles had changed and he felt that he no longer had the creative capacity to adapt or the emotional desire to continue. Also as Salieri aged he moved slowly away from his more liberal political stances as he saw the enlightened reform of Joseph II's reign and the hoped for reforms of the French revolution replaced with more radical revolutionary ideas. As the political situation threatened and eventually overwhelmed Austria which was repeatedly crushed by French political forces Salieri's first and most important biographer  described the emotional effect that this political social and cultural upheaval had on the composer. Mosel noted that these radical changes especially the invasion and defeat of Austria and the occupation of Vienna intertwined with the personal losses that struck Salieri in the same period led to his withdrawal from operatic work. Related to this Mosel quotes the aged composer concerning the radical changes in musical taste that were underway in the age of Beethoven ""From that period circa 1800 I realized that musical taste was gradually changing in a manner completely contrary to that of my own times. Eccentricity and confusion of genres replaced reasoned and masterful simplicity.""

As his teaching and work with the imperial chapel continued his duties required the composition of a large number of sacred works and in his last years it was almost exclusively in religious works and teaching that Salieri occupied himself. Among his compositions written for the chapel were two complete sets of vespers many graduals offertories and four orchestral masses. During this period he lost his only son in 1805 and his wife in 1807.

Salieri continued to conduct publicly including the performance on 18 March 1808 of Haydn's ''The Creation'' during which Haydn collapsed and several premieres by Beethoven including the 1st and 2nd Piano Concertos and ''Wellington's Victory''. He also continued to help administer several charities and organize their musical events.

His remaining secular works in this late period fall into three categories: first large scale cantatas and one oratorio ''Habsburg'' written on patriotic themes or in response to the international political situation pedagogical works written to aid his students in voice and finally simple songs rounds or canons written for home entertainment; many with original poetry by the composer. He also composed one large scale instrumental work in 1815 intended as a study in late classical orchestration: Twenty-Six Variations for the Orchestra on a Theme called La Folia di Spagna. The theme is likely folk derived and is known as ''La Folía''. This simple melodic and harmonic progression had served as an inspiration for many baroque composers and would be used by later romantic and post-romantic composers. Salieri's setting is a brooding work in the minor key which rarely moves far from the original melodic material its main interest lies in the deft and varied handling of orchestral colors. ''La Folia'' was the most monumental set of orchestral variations before Brahms' ''Variations on a Theme by Haydn''.

His teaching of budding young musicians continued and among his pupils in composition (usually vocal) were Ludwig van Beethoven Antonio Casimir Cartellieri Franz Liszt Franz Schubert and many other luminaries of the early Romantic period.  He also instructed many prominent singers throughout his long career including Caterina Canzi. All but the wealthiest of his pupils received their lessons for free a tribute to the kindness Gassmann had shown Salieri as a penniless orphan.

Salieri was committed to medical care and suffered dementia for the last year and a half of his life. He died in Vienna on 7 May 1825 aged 74 and was buried in the Matzleinsdorfer Friedhof on 10 May. At his memorial service on 22 June 1825 his own Requiem in C minor – composed in 1804 – was performed for the first time. His remains were later transferred to the Zentralfriedhof. His monument is adorned by a poem written by Joseph Weigl one of his pupils:

:


Rest in peace! Uncovered by dust
Eternity shall bloom for you.
Rest in peace! In eternal harmonies
Your spirit now is set free.
It expressed itself in enchanting notes
Now it is floating to everlasting beauty.

304,American Sign Language,Population,"Counting the number of ASL signers is difficult because ASL users have never been counted by the American census. The ultimate source for current estimates of the number of ASL users in the United States is a report for the National Census of the Deaf Population (NCDP) by Schein and Delk (1974). Based on a 1972 survey of the NCDP Schein and Delk provided estimates consistent with a signing population between 250000 and 500000. The survey did not distinguish between ASL and other forms of signing; in fact the name ""ASL"" was not yet in widespread use.

Incorrect figures are sometimes cited for the population of ASL speakers in the United States based on misunderstandings of known statistics. Demographics of the deaf population have been confused with those of ASL use since adults who become deaf late in life rarely use ASL in the home. This accounts for currently cited estimations which are greater than 500000; such mistaken estimations can reach as high as 15000000. A 100000-person lower bound has been cited for ASL users; the source of this figure is unclear but it may be an estimate of prelingual deafness which is correlated with but not equivalent to signing.

ASL is sometimes incorrectly cited as the third- or fourth-most-spoken language in the United States. These figures misquote Schein and Delk (1974) who actually concluded that ASL speakers constituted the third-largest population ''requiring an interpreter in court''. Although this would make ASL the third-most used language among monolinguals other than English it does not imply that it is the fourth-most-spoken language in the United States since speakers of other languages may also speak English.

304,American Sign Language,Iconicity,"
A common misconception is that signs are iconically self-explanatory that they are a transparent imitation of what they mean or even that they are pantomime. In fact many signs bear no resemblance to their referent either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. This may be due to the fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.

In the era of the influential linguist Ferdinand de Saussure it was assumed that the mapping between form and meaning in language must be completely arbitrary. Although onomatopoeia is a clear exception since words like 'choo-choo' bear clear resemblance to the sounds that they mimic the Saussurean approach was to treat these as marginal exceptions. ASL with its significant inventory of iconic signs directly challenges this theory.

Research on acquisition of pronouns in ASL has shown that children do not always take advantage of the iconic properties of signs when interpreting their meaning. It has been found that when children acquire the pronoun ""you"" the iconicity of the point (at the child) is often confused being treated more like a name. This is a similar finding to research in oral languages on pronoun acquisition. It has also been found that iconicity of signs does not affect immediate memory and recall; less iconic signs are remembered just as well as highly iconic signs.

In December 2009 an agreement on military assistance was signed by Turkey and Azerbaijan. The agreement envisions Ankara's supplying Azerbaijan with weapons military equipment and if necessary soldiers in case war with Armenia over Karabakh resumes.

Turkey has provided Azerbaijan with infantry weapons tactical vehicles (jeeps trucks etc.) professional training military organization technology transfer licensed military hardware production and other services. Due to help from Turkish specialists and instructors thousands of Azerbaijani officers have been trained to western standards.

The military position as international importance of Azerbaijan increased with agreement between Azerbaijan and Turkey on the participation an Azerbaijani peacekeeping platoon in the staff of Turkish battalion in Kosovo.

Since 1992 Azerbaijan and Turkey have signed more than 100 military protocols some of the major protocols include:
* Cooperation of staff members
* National security cooperation in the topographical area
* Forming and training of profession school of forces kind of Baku
* Carrying out of the material and technical purchasing
* Military industry cooperation
* Development of the 5th Army Corps also known as Nakhchivan Army Corps in Nakhchivan

* Assistance on training material and technical between the Azerbaijan Border Guard and the Turkish Armed Forces.
* Long-term economical and military cooperation and application of the financial aid
* Application of material and technical provision

In May 2011 Azerbaijan had discussed the purchase of long-range rockets from two Chinese companies the minister of the defence industry has said. Other arms deals were signed with Turkey. Turkish Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul and Yaver Jamalov signed a protocol of intent on future joint production of two types of output – 107-mm rockets and the national rifle possibly the Mehmetçik-1. A protocol of intent was signed the same day with the Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation MKEK on the joint production of 120-mm mortar launchers. This project will come into force in a few months time. Agreement has also been reached with Turkish company Aselsan on the production of some types of defence output in Azerbaijan specifically the latest types of weapons' sights. These projects will probably happen in the near future too. Recently Turkish defense industries secretariat told that an export version of the T-155 Firtina self-propelled howitser is almost done and could start production. T-155 has been powered by a German MTU power pack which restricts the sale to some countries like Azerbaijan. The Turkish manufacturer MKEK has announced that they have found an alternate supplier for the power pack where Azerbaijan showed interest to buy the high tech more capable 155mm 52 caliber from Turkish authorities.

This has included Special Forces and naval aid consultations with United States European Command and linkages through the U.S. National Guard State Partnership Program.

On 19 May 2006 Azerbaijani Defense Minister Safar Abiyev and the then commander of United States Air Forces in Europe General Tom Hobbins met in Baku to discuss military cooperation. He said the objective of his visit was to become familiar with the state of Azerbaijani armed forces. Hobbins pointed to the progress made in the NATO-Azerbaijan relations saying that the successful implementation of the NATO Partnership for Peace program in Azerbaijan has brought the country even closer to the alliance. He said that the two countries' air forces will expand cooperation.

Azerbaijan and Israel cooperate on numerous areas of the defense industry. Azerbaijan has shown great interest in Israeli technology over the years. In particular an agreement was reached over the construction of the factory of intelligence and combat drones in Azerbaijan.

The Israeli defense company Elta Systems Ltd has had cooperation from Azerbaijan in building the TecSAR reconnaissance satellite system which can take high-definition photos of ground surfaces in all weather conditions. According to Azerbaijani military experts the TecSAR system will be indispensable for military operations in the mountainous terrains of Azerbaijan.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Azerbaijan actively cooperate on defence institutional reforms and have developed practical cooperation in many other areas. Azerbaijan's Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP) and its Partnership for Peace (PfP) linkages lay out the programme of cooperation between Azerbaijan and NATO.

The Azerbaijani government has however delayed implementing IPAP-recommended reforms however in part at least because no decision had been taken to seek NATO membership. This is because Azerbaijan's foreign policy 'seeks to balance interests with the U.S. EU Russia and Iran.'

According to a NATO diplomatic source some key officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels were pushing hard for engaging Azerbaijan on the membership question. ""Turkey Romania Italy Poland the United Kingdom and the Baltic states"" are among the member-states also backing a fast track for Azerbaijan's NATO membership.

However Azerbaijan made its policy of not being aligned with a geopolitical/military structure official when it became a full member of the Non-Aligned Movement in 2011.

There is also a limited amount of military cooperation with the other countries of GUAM: Georgia Ukraine Azerbaijan and Moldova.

254,Economy of Armenia,Government revenue and taxation,"The Armenian government collected 383.5 billion drams ($1.26 billion) in various taxes in the first nine months of 2008 (a 33.2 percent increase from the same period last year).

Many large companies have a privileged status when it comes to taxation.  Big business is not taxed in proportion to its capacity and output and the disproportionate burden falls on small and medium size businesses.

===New value-added tax===
Over half of the tax revenues in the January–August 2008 time period were generated from value-added taxes (VAT) of 20%. By comparison corporate profit tax generated less than 16 percent of the revenues. This suggests that tax collection in Armenia is improving at the expense of ordinary citizens rather than wealthy citizens (who have been the main beneficiaries of Armenia's double-digit economic growth in recent years).

===Tax evasion===
Many Armenian companies especially those owned by government-connected tycoons have long reported suspiciously low earnings thereby avoiding paying larger taxes.

878,Folklore of the United States,Tall Tales,"The tall tale is a fundamental element of American folk literature. The tall tale's origins are seen in the bragging contests that often occurred when men of the American frontier gathered. A tall tale is a story with unbelievable elements related as if it were true and factual. Some such stories are exaggerations of actual events; others are completely fictional tales set in a familiar setting such as the American Old West or the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. They are usually humorous or good-natured. The line between myth and tall tale is distinguished primarily by age; many myths exaggerate the exploits of their heroes but in tall tales the exaggeration looms large to the extent of becoming the whole of the story.

===Based on historical figures===

*John Chapman (September 26 1774 – March 18 1845) widely known as Johnny Appleseed was an American pioneer nurseryman who introduced apple trees to large parts of Pennsylvania Ohio Indiana and Illinois. He became an American legend while still alive largely because of his kind and generous ways and the symbolic importance he attributed to apples. Johnny Appleseed is remembered in American popular culture by his traveling song or Swedenborgian hymn (""The Lord is good to me..."").
*Daniel Boone (November 2 1734 O.S. October 22 – September 26 1820) was an American pioneer explorer and frontiersman whose frontier exploits made him one of the first folk heroes of the United States.
*""Davy"" Crockett (August 17 1786 – March 6 1836) was a 19th-century American folk hero frontiersman soldier and politician. He is commonly referred to in popular culture by the epithet ""King of the Wild Frontier"". He represented Tennessee in the U.S. House of Representatives served in the Texas Revolution and died at the Battle of the Alamo.
*Mike Fink (c. 1770/1780 – c. 1823) called ""king of the keelboaters"" was a semi-legendary brawler and river boatman who exemplified the tough and hard-drinking men who ran keelboats up and down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.
*Martha Jane Canary (May 1 1852 – August 1 1903) better known as Calamity Jane was an American frontierswoman and professional scout best known for her claim of being an acquaintance of Wild Bill Hickok. She is said to have also exhibited kindness and compassion especially to the sick and needy. It was from her that Bret Harte took his famous character of Cherokee Sal in ''The Luck of Roaring Camp''.
*Jigger Johnson (1871-1935) was a lumberjack and log driver from northern New England who is known for his numerous off-the-job exploits such as catching bobcats alive with his bare hands and drunken brawls. 
*John Henry was an African-American railroad worker who is said to have worked as a ""steel-driving man""—a man tasked with hammering a steel drill into rock to make holes for explosives to blast the rock away in constructing a railroad tunnel. According to legend John Henry's prowess as a steel-driver was measured in a race against a steam powered hammer which he won only to die in victory with his hammer in his hand and his heart giving out from stress. The ""Ballad of John Henry"" is a musical rendition of his story.

Other historical figures include Titanic survivor Molly Brown Wild West showman Buffalo Bill Cody and sharpshooter Annie Oakley.

===Fictional characters===

*Paul Bunyan is a lumberjack figure in North American folklore and tradition. One of the most famous and popular North American folklore heroes he is usually described as a giant as well as a lumberjack of unusual skill and is often accompanied in stories by his animal companion Babe the Blue Ox. The character originated in folktales circulated among lumberjacks in the Northeastern United States and eastern Canada first appearing in print in a story published by Northern Michigan journalist James MacGillivray in 1906.
*The Lone Ranger is a fictional hero of the west who fought raiders and robbers in the Texas area. The sole survivor of a group of six rangers he set out to bring the criminals who killed his brother to justice.
*John the Conqueror also known as High John the Conqueror and many other folk variants is a folk hero from African-American folklore. John the Conqueror was an African prince who was sold as a slave in the Americas. Despite his enslavement his spirit was never broken and he survived in folklore as a sort of a trickster figure because of the tricks he played to evade his masters. Joel Chandler Harris's 'Br'er Rabbit' of the Uncle Remus stories is said to be patterned after High John the Conqueror.
*Pecos Bill is an American cowboy apocryphally immortalized in numerous tall tales of the Old West during American westward expansion into the Southwest of Texas New Mexico Southern California and Arizona
MOLLY PITCHER. (Ten American Girls from History 1917)

*Molly Pitcher was a nickname given to a woman said to have fought in the American Battle of Monmouth who is generally believed to have been Mary Ludwig Hays McCauly. Since various Molly Pitcher tales grew in the telling many historians regard Molly Pitcher as folklore rather than history or suggest that Molly Pitcher may be a composite image inspired by the actions of a number of real women. The name itself may have originated as a nickname given to women who carried water to men on the battlefield during the war.
*Captain Stormalong was an American folk hero and the subject of numerous nautical-themed tall tales originating in Massachusetts. Stormalong was said to be a sailor and a giant some 30 feet tall; he was the master of a huge clipper ship known in various sources as either the Courser or the Tuscarora a ship so tall that it had hinged masts to avoid catching on the moon.

671,Archimedean solid,Origin of name,"The Archimedean solids take their name from Archimedes who discussed them in a now-lost work. Pappus refers to it stating that Archimedes listed 13 polyhedra. During the Renaissance artists and mathematicians valued ''pure forms'' with high symmetry and by around 1620 Johannes Kepler had completed the rediscovery of the 13 polyhedra as well as defining the prisms antiprisms and the non-convex solids known as Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra.

Kepler may have also found the elongated square gyrobicupola (pseudorhombicuboctahedron): at least he once stated that there were 14 Archimedean solids. However his published enumeration only includes the 13 uniform polyhedra and the first clear statement of the pseudorhombicuboctahedron's existence was made in 1905 by Duncan Sommerville.

8,An American in Paris,Recordings,"First recording
''An American in Paris'' has been frequently recorded. The first recording was made for RCA Victor in 1929 with Nathaniel Shilkret conducting the RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra drawn from members of the Philadelphia Orchestra. Gershwin was on hand to ""supervise"" the recording; however Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio. Then a little later Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording. This recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that Gershwin had intended using the notes A flat B flat a higher C and a lower D.  The radio broadcast of the September 8 1937 Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert in which ''An American in Paris'' also conducted by Shilkret was second on the program was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set. Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra recorded the work for RCA Victor including one of the first stereo recordings of the music. In 1945 Arturo Toscanini conducting  the NBC Symphony Orchestra recorded the piece for RCA Victor one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer. The Seattle Symphony also recorded a version in 1990 of Gershwin's original score before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today.  Harry James released a version of the blues section on his 1953 album ''One Night Stand'' recorded live at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago (Columbia GL 522 and CL 522). Conductor Steven Richman and Harmonie Ensemble New York released a recording of Gershwin's original orchestrations in 2016 on Harmonia Mundi.

273,Adelaide,Geography,"Satellite image of Adelaide's metropolitan area. The Adelaide Hills is the green area to the right of the image.
City map of Adelaide Australia.

Adelaide is north of the Fleurieu Peninsula on the Adelaide Plains between the Gulf St Vincent and the low-lying Mount Lofty Ranges. The city stretches  from the coast to the foothills and  from Gawler at its northern extent to Sellicks Beach in the south. According to the Regional Development Australia an Australian government planning initiative the ""Adelaide Metropolitan Region"" has a total land area of  while a more expansive definition by the Australia Bureau of Statistics defines a ""Greater Adelaide"" statistical area totalling .  The city sits at an average elevation of  above sea level.  Mount Lofty east of the Adelaide metropolitan region in the Adelaide Hills at an elevation of  is the tallest point of the city and in the state south of Burra.

Much of Adelaide was bushland before British settlement with some variation – sandhills swamps and marshlands were prevalent around the coast. The loss of the sandhills to urban development had a particularly destructive effect on the coastline due to erosion. Where practical the government has implemented programs to rebuild and vegetate sandhills at several of Adelaide's beachside suburbs. Much of the original vegetation has been cleared with what is left to be found in reserves such as the Cleland Conservation Park and Belair National Park. A number of creeks and rivers flow through the Adelaide region. The largest are the Torrens and Onkaparinga catchments. Adelaide relies on its many reservoirs for water supply with the Happy Valley Reservoir supplying around 40% and the much larger Mount Bold Reservoir 10% of Adelaide's domestic requirements respectively.

Adelaide and its surrounding area is one of the most seismically active regions in Australia. On 1 March 1954 at 3:40 am Adelaide experienced its largest recorded earthquake to date with the epicentre 12 km from the city centre at Darlington and a reported magnitude of 5.6. There have been smaller earthquakes in 2010 2011 and 2014.

=== Urban layout ===

North Terrace (right) and Pulteney Street (left) looking south-west from Bonython Hall.

Adelaide is a planned city designed by the first surveyor-general of South Australia Colonel William Light. His plan now known as '''Light's Vision''' arranged Adelaide in a grid with five squares in the Adelaide city centre and a ring of parks known as the Adelaide Parklands surrounding it. Light's selection of the location for the city was initially unpopular with the early settlers as well as South Australia's first governor John Hindmarsh due to its distance from the harbour at Port Adelaide and the lack of fresh water there. Light successfully persisted with his choice of location against this initial opposition.

The benefits of Light's design are numerous: Adelaide has had wide multi-lane roads from its beginning an easily navigable cardinal direction grid layout and an expansive green ring around the city centre. There are two sets of ring roads in Adelaide that have resulted from the original design. The inner ring route (A21) borders the parklands and the outer route (A3/A13/A16/A17) completely bypasses the inner city via (in clockwise order) Grand Junction Road Hampstead Road Ascot Avenue Portrush Road Cross Road and South Road.

Suburban expansion has to some extent outgrown Light's original plan. Numerous former outlying villages and ""country towns"" as well as the satellite city of Elizabeth have been enveloped by its suburban sprawl. Expanding developments in the Adelaide Hills region led to the construction of the South Eastern Freeway to cope with growth which has subsequently led to new developments and further improvements to that transport corridor. Similarly the booming development in Adelaide's South led to the construction of the Southern Expressway.

New roads are not the only transport infrastructure developed to cope with the urban growth. The O-Bahn Busway is an example of a unique solution to Tea Tree Gully's transport woes in the 1980s. The development of the nearby suburb of Golden Grove in the late 1980s is an example of well-thought-out urban planning.

King William Street one of the widest main streets in an Australian capital city viewed from Victoria Square.

In the 1960s a Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study Plan was proposed in order to cater for the future growth of the city. The plan involved the construction of freeways expressways and the upgrade of certain aspects of the public transport system. The then premier Steele Hall approved many parts of the plan and the government went as far as purchasing land for the project. The later Labor government elected under Don Dunstan shelved the plan but allowed the purchased land to remain vacant should the future need for freeways arise. In 1980 the Liberal party won government and premier David Tonkin committed his government to selling off the land acquired for the MATS plan ensuring that even when needs changed the construction of most MATS-proposed freeways would be impractical. Some parts of this land have been used for transport (e.g. the O-Bahn Busway and Southern Expressway) while most has been progressively subdivided for residential use.

In 2008 the SA Government announced plans for a network of transport-oriented developments across the Adelaide metropolitan area and purchased a 10 hectare industrial site at Bowden for $52.5 million as the first of these developments. The site covers 102478 square metres or about 10 hectares and is bounded by Park Terrace to the south the Adelaide to Outer Harbour railway line to the west Drayton Street to the north and Sixth and Seventh Streets to the east.

==== Housing ====


Historically Adelaide's suburban residential areas have been characterised by single-storey detached houses built on  blocks. A relative lack of suitable locally available timber for construction purposes led to the early development of a brick-making industry as well as the use of stone for houses and other buildings. By 1891 68% of houses were built of stone 15% of timber and 10% of brick with brick also being widely used in stone houses for quoins door and window surrounds and chimneys and fireplaces.

There is a wide variety in the styles of these predominately brick and to a lesser degree stone and/or stone-faced single-storey detached houses. After both of the World Wars the use of red bricks was popular. In the 1960s cream bricks became popular and in the 1970s deep red and brown bricks became popular. Until the 1970s roofs tended to be clad with corrugated iron or clay tiles (usually red clay). Since then cement tiles and colourbond corrugated (and other types of) iron have also become popular. Most roofs are pitched; flat roofs are not common. Up to the 1970s the majority of houses were of ""double brick"" construction on concrete footings with timber floors laid on joists supported by ""dwarf walls"". Due to Adelaide's reactive soils (particularly Keswick Clay black earth and some red-brown earth soils) since then houses have mainly been constructed of ""brick veneer"" over a timber frame (and more recently over a steel frame) on a concrete raft slab foundation. The use of precast concrete panels for floor and wall construction has also increased. In addition to this a significant factor in Adelaide's suburban history is the role of the South Australian Housing Trust.

=== Climate ===


Adelaide has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification ''Csa'') with warm to hot dry summers and mild short winters with most precipitation falling in the winter months. Adelaide receives enough annual precipitation to avoid Köppen's BSh (semi-arid climate) classification. Rainfall is unreliable light and infrequent throughout summer. In contrast the winter has fairly reliable rainfall with June being the wettest month of the year averaging around 80 mm. Frosts are occasional with the most notable occurrences in July 1908 and July 1982. Hail is also common in winter. Adelaide is a windy city—it experiences wind chill in winter which makes the temperature seem colder than it actually is. Snowfall in the metropolitan area is extremely uncommon although light and sporadic falls in the nearby hills and at Mount Lofty occur during winter. Dewpoints in the summer typically range from .

The average annual temperature of the sea ranges from  in August to  in February.

690,Art Deco,Origins,"
===Society of Decorative Artists (1901–1913)===
A fireplace screen by the Symbolist painter Odilon Redon now in the Musée d'Orsay Paris (1908)
The emergence of Art Deco was closely connected with the rise in status of decorative artists who until late in the 19th century had been considered simply as artisans. The term ""arts décoratifs"" had been invented in 1875 giving the designers of furniture textiles and other decoration official status. The Société des artistes décorateurs (Society of decorative artists) or SAD was founded in 1901 and decorative artists were given the same rights of authorship as painters and sculptors. A similar movement developed in Italy. The first international exhibition devoted entirely to the decorative arts the ''Esposizione international d'Arte decorative moderna''  was held in Turin in 1902. Several new magazines devoted to decorative arts were founded in Paris including ''Arts et décoration'' and ''L'Art décoratif moderne''. Decorative arts sections were introduced into the annual salons of the Sociéte des artistes français and later in the'' Salon d'automne''. French nationalism also played a part in the resurgence of decorative arts; French designers felt challenged by the increasing exports of less expensive German furnishings. In 1911 the SAD proposed the holding of a major new international exposition of decorative arts in 1912. No copies of old styles were to be permitted; only modern works. The exhibit was postponed until 1914 then because of the war postponed until 1925 when it gave its name to the whole family of styles known as Déco.

The Paris department stores and fashion designers also played an important part in the rise of Art Déco. Established firms including the luggage maker Louis Vuitton silverware firm Christofle glass designer René Lalique and the jewelers Louis Cartier and Boucheron who all began designing products in more modern styles. Beginning in 1900 the Department stores had recruited decorative artists to work in their design studios. The decoration of the 1912 Salon d'Automne had been entrusted to the department store Printemps. During the same year Printemps created its own workshop called ""Primavera"". By 1920 Primavera employed more than three hundred artists. The styles ranged from the updated versions of Louis XIV Louis XVI and especially Louis Philippe furniture made by Louis Süe and the Primavera workshop to more modern forms from the workshop of the Au Louvre department store. Other designers including Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann and Paul Foliot refused to use mass production and insisted that each piece be made individually by hand. The early art deco style featured luxurious and exotic materials such as ebony and ivory and silk very bright colors and stylized motifs particularly baskets and bouquets of flowers of all colors giving a modernist look.

===Théâtre des Champs-Élysées (1910–1913)===

The Théâtre des Champs-Élysées (1910–1913) by Auguste Perret was the first landmark Art Deco building completed in Paris. Previously reinforced concrete had been used only for industrial and apartment buildings Perret had built the first modern reinforced concrete apartment building in Paris on rue Benjamin Franklin in 1903-04. Henri Sauvage another important future Art Deco architect built another in 1904 at 7 rue Trétaigne (1904). From 1908 to 1910 the 21-year old Le Corbusier worked as a draftsman in Perret's office learning the techniques of concrete construction. Perret's building had clean rectangular form geometric decoration and straight lines the future trademarks of Art Deco. The decor of the theater was also revolutionary; the facade was decorated with plaques of Art Deco sculpture by Antoine Bourdelle a dome by Maurice Denis paintings by Édouard Vuillard and an Art Deco curtain Ker-Xavier Roussel. The theater became famous as the venue for many of the first performances of the Ballets Russes. Perret and Sauvage became the leading Art Deco architects in Paris in the 1920s.

At its birth between 1910 and 1914 Art Deco was an explosion of colors featuring bright and often clashing hues frequently in floral designs presented in furniture upholstery carpets screens wallpaper and fabrics. Many colorful works including chairs and a table by Maurice Dufrene and a bright Gobelin carpet by Paul Follot were presented at the 1912 Salon des artistes décorateurs. In 1912–1913 designer Alfred Karbowsky made a floral chair with a parrot design for the hunting lodge of art collector Jacques Doucet. The furniture designers Louis Süe and André Mare made their first appearance at the 1912 exhibit under the name of the ''Atelier Française'' combining colorful fabrics with exotic and expensive materials including ebony and ivory. After World War I they became one of the most prominent French interior design firms producing the furniture for the first-class salons and cabins of the French transatlantic ocean liners.

The vivid colors of Art Deco came from many sources including the exotic set designs by Leon Bakst for the Ballets Russes which caused a sensation in Paris just before World War I. Some of the colors were inspired by the earlier Fauvism movement led by Henri Matisse; others by the Orphism of painters such as Sonia Delaunay; others by the movement known as the Nabis and in the work of symbolist painter Odilon Redon who designed fireplace screens and other decorative objects. Bright colors were a feature of the work of fashion designer Paul Poiret whose work influenced both Art Deco fashion and interior design.

===Cubist House (1912)===

The art style known as Cubism appeared in France between 1907 and 1912 influencing the development of Art Deco. The Cubists themselves under the influence of Paul Cézanne were interested in the simplification of forms to their geometric essentials: the cylinder the sphere the cone.

In 1912 the artists of the Section d'Or exhibited works considerably more accessible to the general public than the analytical Cubism of Picasso and Braque. The Cubist vocabulary was poised to attract fashion furniture and interior designers.

In the 1912 writings of André Vera. ''Le Nouveau style'' published in the journal ''L'Art décoratif'' he expressed the rejection of Art Nouveau forms (asymmetric polychrome and picturesque) and called for ''simplicité volontaire symétrie manifeste l'ordre et l'harmonie'' themes that would eventually become common within Art Deco; though with time the Deco style was often extremely colorful and anything but simple.

In the ''Art Décoratif'' section of the 1912 Salon d'Automne an architectural installation was exhibited known as the ''La Maison Cubiste''. The facade was designed by Raymond Duchamp-Villon. The decor of the house was by the firm of Louis Süe and André Mare who had formed a company called the ''Atlelier Français'' in 1912. ''La Maison Cubiste'' was a furnished installation with a facade a staircase wrought iron banisters a bedroom a living room—the ''Salon Bourgeois'' where paintings by Albert Gleizes Jean Metzinger Marie Laurencin Marcel Duchamp Fernand Léger and Roger de La Fresnaye were hung. Thousands of spectators at the salon passed through the full-scale model.

The facade of the house designed by Duchamp-Villon was not very radical by modern standards; the lintels and pediments had prismatic shapes but otherwise the facade resembled an ordinary house of the period. The rooms were furnished by Mare with neo-Louis XVI and Louis-Philippe style chairs and sofas that were updated with more angular features to make hem go with the Cubist paintings. The critic Emile Sedeyn described Mare's work in the magazine ''Art et Décoration'': ""He does not embarrass himself with simplicity for he multiplies flowers wherever they can be put. The effect he seeks is obviously one of picturesqueness and gaiety. He achieves it."" The Cubist element was provided by the paintings. Despite its tameness the installation was attacked by some critics as extremely radical which helped make for its success. This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show New York Chicago and Boston. Thanks largely to the exhibition the term ""Cubist"" began to be applied to anything modern from women's haircuts to clothing to theater performances.

The Cubist style continued within Art Deco even as Deco branched out in many other directions. In 1927 Cubists Joseph Csaky Jacques Lipchitz Louis Marcoussis Henri Laurens the sculptor Gustave Miklos and others collaborated in the decoration of a Studio House rue Saint-James Neuilly-sur-Seine designed by the architect Paul Ruaud and owned by the French fashion designer Jacques Doucet also a collector of Post-Impressionist art by Henri Matisse and Cubist paintings (including ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' which he bought directly from Picasso's studio). Laurens designed the fountain Csaky designed Doucet's staircase Lipchitz made the fireplace mantel and Marcoussis made a Cubist rug.

Besides the Cubist artists Doucet brought in other Deco interior designers to help in decorating the house including Pierre Legrain who was in charge of organizing the decoration and Paul Iribe Marcel Coard André Groult Eileen Gray and Rose Adler to provide furniture. The decor included massive pieces made of macassar ebony inspired by African art and furniture covered with Morocco leather crocodile skin and snakeskin and patterns taken from African designs.

901,Apostolic succession,Apostolic founders,"
An early understanding of apostolic succession is represented by the traditional claims of various churches as organised around important episcopal sees to have been founded by specific apostles. On the basis of these traditions the churches claim to have inherited specific authority doctrines and/or practices on the authority of their founding apostle(s) which is understood to be continued by the bishops of the apostolic throne of the church that each founded and whose original leader he was. Thus:

*The See of Rome claims to have been founded by Simon Peter traditionally called the ""Chief of the Apostles"".
*The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople the primary patriarchate of the Eastern Orthodox Church claims the Apostle Andrew (brother of Simon Peter) as its founder.
*The Patriarch of Alexandria (Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria and Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria) claims to have been founded by Mark the Evangelist.
*The Patriarchate of Antioch (Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch Syriac Orthodox Church Syriac Catholic Church Maronite Patriarchate of Antioch and the Whole Levant) claims to have been founded by Paul.
*The Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem claims to have been founded by James (brother of Jesus).
*The Armenian Apostolic Church based at Etchmiadzin claims to have been founded by the Apostles Bartholomew and Jude Thaddeus.
*The following bodies claim to have been founded by the Apostle Thomas: the Assyrian Church of the East the Ancient Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church originating in or around Mesopotamia and churches based in Kerala India having Syriac roots and generically known as the Saint Thomas Christians: the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church and the Mar Thoma Syrian Church.
*The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church claims founding by Philip the Evangelist.
*The Orthodox Church of Georgia claims the Apostles Andrew and Simon the Zealot as its founders.
*The Orthodox Church of Cyprus based at Nova Justiniana (Erdek) claims to have been founded by the Apostles Paul and Barnabas.
*The Russian Orthodox Church claims a connection with the Apostle Andrew who is said to have visited the area where the city of Kiev later arose.
*The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints claims apostolic succession.  Joseph Smith was visited in 1829 by Peter James and John (three of the original 12 apostles) and by the laying on of hands gave him the keys of the priesthood.  These keys have been since passed down by the laying on of hands to subsequent leaders of the church (aka apostolic succession).

87,Alberta,Economy,"

Alberta's economy was one of the strongest in the world supported by the burgeoning petroleum industry and to a lesser extent agriculture and technology. In 2013 Alberta's per capita GDP exceeded that of the United States Norway or Switzerland and was the highest of any province in Canada at C$84390. This was 56% higher than the national average of C$53870 and more than twice that of some of the Atlantic provinces. In 2006 the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in Canadian history. According to the 2006 census the median annual family income after taxes was $70986 in Alberta (compared to $60270 in Canada as a whole).

Alberta's debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to reach 11.4% in fiscal year 2019-2020 compared to a surplus-to-GDP ratio of 13.4% in 2009-2010.

The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. The region covers a distance of roughly 400 kilometres north to south. In 2001 the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta's population). It is also one of the fastest growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by TD Bank Financial Group found the corridor to be the only Canadian urban centre to amass a US level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian style quality of life offering universal health care benefits. The study found that GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average US metropolitan areas and 40% above other Canadian cities at that time.

The Fraser Institute states that Alberta also has very high levels of economic freedom and rates Alberta as the freest economy in Canada and the second freest economy amongst US states and Canadian provinces. The government of Alberta has invested its earnings wisely; as of September 30 2013 official statistics reported nearly 500 holdings.

In 2014 Merchandise exports totalled US$121.4 Billion. Energy revenues totalled $111.7 Billion and Energy resource exports totalled $90.8 Billion. Farm Cash receipts from agricultural products totalled $12.9 Billion. Shipments of forest products totalled $5.4 Billion while exports were $2.7 Billion. Manufacturing sales totaled $79.4 Billion and Alberta's ICT industries generated over $13 Billion in revenue. In total Alberta's 2014 GDP amassed $364.5 Billion in 2007 dollars or $414.3 Billion in 2015 dollars. In 2015 Alberta's GDP grew despite low oil prices however it was unstable with growth rates as high 4.4% and as low as 0.2%. Should the GDP remain at an average of 2.2% for the last two quarters of 2015 Alberta's GDP should exceed $430 Billion by the end of 2015. However RBC Economics research predicts Alberta's real GDP growth to only average 0.6% for the last 2 quarters of 2015. This estimate predicts a real GDP growth of only 1.4% for 2015. A positive is the predicted 10.8% growth in Nominal GDP and possibly above 11% in 2016.

=== Industry ===
Mildred Lake mine site and plant at the Athabasca oil sands
Alberta is the largest producer of conventional crude oil synthetic crude natural gas and gas products in Canada. Alberta is the world’s second largest exporter of natural gas and the fourth largest producer. Two of the largest producers of petrochemicals in North America are located in central and north-central Alberta. In both Red Deer and Edmonton polyethylene and vinyl manufacturers produce products that are shipped all over the world. Edmonton's oil refineries provide the raw materials for a large petrochemical industry to the east of Edmonton.

The Athabasca oil sands surrounding Fort McMurray have estimated unconventional oil reserves approximately equal to the conventional oil reserves of the rest of the world estimated to be 1.6 trillion barrels (254 km3). Many companies employ both conventional strip mining and non-conventional in situ methods to extract the bitumen from the oil sands. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.

Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands is the price of oil. The oil price increases since 2003 have made it profitable to extract this oil which in the past would give little profit or even a loss. By mid-2014 however rising costs and stabilizing oil prices were threatening the economic viability of some projects. An example of this was the shelving of the Joslyn north project in the Athabasca region in May 2014.

With concerted effort and support from the provincial government several high-tech industries have found their birth in Alberta notably patents related to interactive liquid-crystal display systems. With a growing economy Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds.

=== Agriculture and forestry ===

Agriculture has a significant position in the province's economy. The province has over three million head of cattle and Alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the top producers of plains buffalo (bison) for the consumer market. Sheep for wool and mutton are also raised.

Wheat and canola are primary farm crops with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production; other grains are also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province the once common grain elevator is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing; farmers typically truck the grain to central points.

Alberta is the leading beekeeping province of Canada with some beekeepers wintering hives indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta then migrating north during the summer into the Peace River valley where the season is short but the working days are long for honeybees to produce honey from clover and fireweed. Hybrid canola also requires bee pollination and some beekeepers service this need.

Forestry plays a vital role in Alberta's economy providing over 15000 jobs and contributing billions of dollars annually.  Uses for harvested timber include pulpwood hardwood engineered wood and bioproducts such as chemicals and biofuels.  Recently the United States has been Canada and Alberta's largest importer of hardwood and pulpwood although continued trades issues (Canada–United_States_softwood_lumber_dispute) with the U.S. have likely been a contributing factor towards Alberta's increased focus on Asian markets.

=== Tourism ===


Alberta has been a tourist destination from the early days of the twentieth century with attractions including outdoor locales for skiing hiking and camping shopping locales such as West Edmonton Mall Calgary Stampede outdoor festivals professional athletic events international sporting competitions such as the Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games as well as more eclectic attractions. There are also natural attractions like Elk Island National Park Wood Buffalo National Park and the Columbia Icefield.

According to Alberta Economic Development Calgary and Edmonton both host over four million visitors annually. Banff Jasper and the Rocky Mountains are visited by about three million people per year. Alberta tourism relies heavily on Southern Ontario tourists as well as tourists from other parts of Canada the United States and many other countries.

Alberta's Rockies include well-known tourist destinations Banff National Park and Jasper National Park. The two mountain parks are connected by the scenic Icefields Parkway. Banff is located  west of Calgary on Highway 1 and Jasper is located  west of Edmonton on Yellowhead Highway. Five of Canada's fourteen UNESCO World heritage sites are located within the province: Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park Wood Buffalo National Park Dinosaur Provincial Park and Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump.

Lake Louise in the Canadian Rockies
About 1.2 million people visit the Calgary Stampede a celebration of Canada's own Wild West and the cattle ranching industry. About 700000 people enjoy Edmonton's K-Days (formerly Klondike Days and Capital EX). Edmonton was the gateway to the only all-Canadian route to the Yukon gold fields and the only route which did not require gold-seekers to travel the exhausting and dangerous Chilkoot Pass.

Another tourist destination that draws more than 650000 visitors each year is the Drumheller Valley located northeast of Calgary. Drumheller ""Dinosaur Capital of The World"" offers the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology. Drumheller also had a rich mining history being one of Western Canada's largest coal producers during the war years.

Located in east-central Alberta is Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions a popular tourist attraction operated out of Stettler that offers train excursions into the prairie and caters to tens of thousands of visitors every year.

Alberta has numerous ski resorts most notably Sunshine Village Lake Louise Marmot Basin Norquay and Nakiska.

742,Apollo 10,Mission highlights,"Shortly after trans-lunar injection Young performed the transposition docking and extraction maneuver separating the Command/Service Module (CSM) from the S-IVB stage turning around and docking its nose to the top of the Lunar Module (LM) before separating from the S-IVB. Apollo 10 was the first mission to carry a color television camera inside the spacecraft and made the first live color TV transmissions from space.

LM ''Snoopy'' containing Stafford and Cernan as inspected by Young after separation from ''Charlie Brown''
After reaching lunar orbit three days later Young remained in the Command Module (CM) ''Charlie Brown'' while Stafford and Cernan entered the LM ''Snoopy'' and flew it separately. The LM crew performed the descent orbit insertion maneuver by firing their descent engine and tested their craft's landing radar as they approached the  altitude where powered descent would begin on Apollo 11. They surveyed the landing site in the Sea of Tranquility then separated the descent stage and fired the ascent engine to return to ''Charlie Brown''. The descent stage was left in orbit but eventually crashed onto the lunar surface because of the Moon's non-uniform gravitational field; its location was not tracked.

Upon descent stage separation and ascent engine ignition the Lunar Module began to roll violently because the crew accidentally duplicated commands into the flight computer which took the LM out of abort mode the correct configuration for this maneuver. The live network broadcasts caught Cernan and Stafford uttering several expletives before regaining control of the LM. Cernan has said he observed the horizon spinning eight times over indicating eight rolls of the spacecraft under ascent engine power. While the incident was downplayed by NASA the roll was just several revolutions from being unrecoverable which would have resulted in the LM crashing into the lunar surface.

The ascent stage was loaded with the amount of fuel it would have had remaining if it had lifted off from the surface and reached the altitude at which the Apollo 10 ascent stage fired. The fueled LM weighed  compared to  for the Apollo 11 LM which made the first landing. Craig Nelson wrote in his book ''Rocket Men'' that NASA took special precaution to ensure Stafford and Cernan would not attempt to make the first landing. Nelson quoted Cernan as saying ""A lot of people thought about the kind of people we were: 'Don't give those guys an opportunity to land 'cause they might!' So the ascent module the part we lifted off the lunar surface with was short-fueled. The fuel tanks weren't full. So had we literally tried to land on the Moon we couldn't have gotten off."" In his own memoir Cernan wrote ""Our lander LM-4...was still too heavy to guarantee safe margins for a moon landing.""

After being jettisoned ''Snoopy's'' ascent stage engine was fired to fuel depletion sending it on a trajectory past the Moon into a heliocentric orbit. The Apollo 11 ascent stage was left in lunar orbit to eventually crash; all subsequent ascent stages were intentionally steered into the Moon to obtain readings from seismometers placed on the surface except for the one on Apollo 13 which did not land but was used as a ""life boat"" to get the crew back to Earth and burned up in Earth's atmosphere.
''Snoopy'''s ascent stage orbit was not tracked after 1969 and its current location is unknown. In 2011 a group of amateur astronomers in the UK started a project to search for it.

Splashdown occurred in the Pacific Ocean on May 26 1969 at 16:52:23 UTC about  east of American Samoa. The astronauts were recovered by  and subsequently flown to Pago Pago International Airport in Tafuna for a greeting reception before being flown on a C-141 cargo plane to Honolulu.

After Apollo 10 NASA required astronauts to choose more ""dignified"" names for their Command and Lunar Modules. This proved unenforceable: Apollo 16 astronauts Young Mattingly and Duke chose ''Casper'' as in Casper the Friendly Ghost for their Command Module name. The idea was to give children a way to identify with the mission by using humor.

944,A.S. Roma,History,"
Attilio Ferraris Roma captain during their formative years
A.S. Roma was founded in the summer of 1927 when Italo Foschi initiated the merger of three older Italian Football Championship clubs from the city of Rome; Roman FC SS Alba-Audace and Fortitudo-Pro Roma SGS. The purpose of the merger was to give the Italian capital a strong club to rival that of the more dominant Northern Italian clubs of the time. The only major Roman club to resist the merger was S.S. Lazio because of the intervention of the army General Vaccaro member of the club and executive of Italian Football Federation.
The club played its earliest seasons at the ''Motovelodromo Appio'' stadium before settling in the working-class streets of Testaccio where it built an all-wooden ground ''Campo Testaccio''; this was opened in November 1929. An early season in which Roma made a large mark was the 1930–31 championship the club finished as runners-up behind Juventus. Captain Attilio Ferraris along with Guido Masetti Fulvio Bernardini and Rodolfo Volk were highly important players during this period.

===First title victory and decline===
The Roma of the first scudetto in 1942
After a slump in league form and the departure of high key players Roma eventually rebuilt their squad adding goalscorers such as the Argentine Enrique Guaita. Under the management of Luigi Barbesino the Roman club came close to their first title in 1935–36; finishing just one point behind champions Bologna.

Roma returned to form after being inconsistent for much of the late 1930s; Roma recorded an unexpected title triumph in the 1941–42 season by winning their first ever'' scudetto'' title. The eighteen goals scored by local player Amedeo Amadei were essential to the Alfréd Schaffer coached Roma side winning the title. At the time Italy was involved in World War II and Roma were playing at the ''Stadio del Partito Nazionale Fascista''.

In the years just after the war Roma were unable to recapture their league stature from the early 1940s. Roma finished in the lower half of Serie A for five seasons in a row before eventually succumbing to their only ever relegation to Serie B at the end of the 1950–51 season; around a decade after their championship victory. Under future national team manager Giuseppe Viani promotion straight back up was achieved.

After returning to the Serie A Roma managed to stabilise themselves as a top half club again with players such as Egisto Pandolfini Dino Da Costa and Dane Helge Bronée. Their best finish of this period was under the management of Englishman Jesse Carver when in 1954–55 they finished as runners-up after Udinese who originally finished second were relegated for corruption.
Although Roma were unable to break into the top four during the following decade they did achieve some measure of cup success. Their first honour outside of Italy was recorded in 1960–61 when Roma won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup by beating Birmingham City 4–2 in the finals. A few years later Roma won their first Coppa Italia trophy in 1963–64 by beating Torino 1–0.

Their lowest point came during the 1964–65 season when manager Juan Carlos Lorenzo announced that the club could not pay its players and was unlikely to be able to afford to travel to Vicenza to fulfil its next fixture. Supporters kept the club going with a fundraiser at the Sistine Theatre and bankruptcy was avoided with the election of a new club president Franco Evangelisti.

Their second Coppa Italia trophy was won in 1968–69 when it competed in a small league like system. Giacomo Losi set a Roma appearance record during 1969 with 450 appearances in all competitions the record he set would last for 38 years.

===Time of mixed fortunes===
Club captain Giacomo Losi with the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1960-61
Roma were able to add another cup to their collection in 1972 with a 3–1 victory over Blackpool in the Anglo-Italian Cup. During much of the 1970s Roma's appearance in the top half of Serie A was sporadic. The best place the club were able to achieve during the decade was third in 1974–75. Notable players who turned out for the club during this period included midfielders Giancarlo De Sisti and Francesco Rocca.

The dawning of a newly successful era in Roma's footballing history was brought in with another Coppa Italia victory they beat Torino on penalties to win the 1979–80 cup. Roma would reach heights in the league which they had not touched since the 1940s by narrowly and controversially finishing as runners-up to Juventus in 1980–81. Former Milan player Nils Liedholm was the manager at the time with players such as Bruno Conti Agostino Di Bartolomei Roberto Pruzzo and Falcão.

The Roma of the second scudetto in 1983
The second ''scudetto'' did not elude Roma for much longer; in 1982–83 the Roman club won the title for the first time in 41 years amidst celebrations in the capital. The following season Roma finished as runners-up in Italy and collected a Coppa Italia title they also finished as runners-up in the European Cup final of 1984. The European Cup final with Liverpool ended in a 1–1 draw with a goal from Pruzzo but Roma eventually lost the penalty shoot-out. Roma's successful run in the 1980s would finish with a runners-up spot in 1985–86 and a Coppa Italia victory beating out Sampdoria 3–2.

After that a comparative decline began in the league one of the few league highs from the following period being a third-place finish in 1987–88. At the start of the 1990s the club was involved in an all-Italian UEFA Cup final where they lost 2–1 to Internazionale in 1991; the same season the club won its seventh Coppa Italia trophy and ended runners-up to Sampdoria in the Supercoppa Italiana. Aside from finishing runners-up to Torino in a Coppa Italia final the rest of the decade was largely sub-par in the history of Roma; especially in the league where the highest they could manage was fourth in 1997–98. The early 1990s also saw the emergence of homegrown striker Francesco Totti who would go on to be an important member of the team and the club's iconic captain.

===In the new millennium===

====2000–2010====
Curva Sud are overjoyed
Roma returned to form in the 2000s starting the decade in great style by winning their third ever Serie A title in 2000–01; the ''scudetto'' was won on the last day of the season by beating Parma 3–1 edging out Juventus by two points. The club's captain Francesco Totti was a large reason for the title victory and he would become one of the main heroes in the club's history going on to break several club records. Other important players during this period included Aldair Cafu Gabriel Batistuta and Vincenzo Montella.

The club attempted to defend the title in the following season but ended as runners-up to Juventus by just one point. This would be the start of Roma finishing as runners-up many times in both Serie A and Coppa Italia during the 2000s; they lost out 4–2 to AC Milan in the Coppa Italia final of 2003 and lost out to Milan again by finishing second in Serie A for the 2003–04 season. The club also re-capitalized several time in 2003–04 season. In November 2003 €37.5 million was injected by ""Roma 2000"" to cover the half-year loss and loss carried from previous year. and again on 30 June for €44.57 million. Through stock market a further €19.850 million of new shares issued and at the year end the share capital was €19.878 million which unchanged . The following season also saw the departure of Walter Samuel for €25 million and Emerson for €28 million which decreased the strength of the squad thus ''Giallorossi'' finished as the eighth place one of the worst of recent season.

Francesco Totti current captain with the 2007–08 Coppa Italia

On 9 July 2006 Roma's Francesco Totti Daniele De Rossi and Simone Perrotta were part of the Italy team that beat France in the 2006 FIFA World Cup final. A Serie A scandal was revealed during 2006 and Roma were one of the teams not involved; after punishments were handed out Roma was re-classified as runners-up for 2005–06; the same season in which they finished second in the Coppa Italia losing to Internazionale. In the two following seasons 2006–07 and 2007–08 Roma finished as Serie A runners-up meaning that in the 2000s Roma have finished in the top two positions more than any other decade in their history Meanwhile in the UEFA Champions League during both of these seasons they reached the quarter-finals before going out to Manchester United. Despite the sloppy start in the 2008–09 Champions League Roma managed to reach the knockout stage ahead of Chelsea in their group thus finishing for the first time in their history as winners of the group stage. The ''Giallorossi'' however would lose to Arsenal in the knockout stage on penalty kicks ending their Champions League campaign.

After a disappointing start to the 2009–10 season Claudio Ranieri replaced Luciano Spalletti as head coach. At the time of the switch Roma lay bottom of the Serie A table after losses to Juventus and Genoa. Despite this setback Roma would later embark on an incredible unbeaten streak of 24 matches in the league – with the last of the 24 being a 2–1 win over rivals Lazio whereby Roma came from 1–0 down at half-time to defeat their city rivals after Ranieri courageously substituted both Totti and De Rossi at the interval. The Giallorossi were on top of the table at one point before a loss to U.C. Sampdoria later in the season. Roma would finish runners-up to Inter yet again in both Serie A and the Coppa Italia. This rounded out a highly successful decade in Roma's history following somewhat mediocre results of the 1990s. During the 2000s Roma had finally recaptured the ''Scudetto'' two Coppa Italia trophies and their first two Supercoppa Italiana titles. Other notable contributions to the club's history have included a return to the Champions League quarter-finals (in the 2006–07 and 2007–08 editions) since 1984 six runners up positions in the league four Coppa Italia finals and three Supercoppa finals – marking Roma's greatest ever decade.

====The ""AS Roma SPV LLC"" era====
In the summer of 2010 the Sensi family agreed to relinquish their control of Roma as part of a debt-settlement agreement. This brought an end to the presidential reign of the Sensi family who had presided over the club since 1993. Until a new owner was appointed Rosella Sensi would continue her directorial role of the club. The 2010–11 season had once again seen Roma start off with mixed fortunes on both a domestic and European level. These included losses against teams like Cagliari Brescia and a 2–0 defeat against Bayern Munich in the group stages of the Champions League a match which saw manager Claudio Ranieri openly criticised by his players. However these were accompanied by victories against Inter and a sensational victory against Bayern in the return fixture which saw Roma fight back from 0–2 down at half-time to emerge as 3–2 winners. Following a series of poor results which saw Roma engage in a winless-streak of five consecutive matches Ranieri resigned as head coach in February 2011 and former striker Vincenzo Montella was appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season. It was also during this season that Roma icon Francesco Totti scored his 200th Serie A goal against Fiorentina in March 2011 – becoming only the sixth ever player to achieve such a feat.
Francesco Totti  the top goalscorer and the most capped player in the Roma's history.
On 16 April 2011 the takeover contract was closed with an American investment group led by Thomas R. DiBenedetto with James Pallotta Michael Ruane and Richard D'Amore as partners. DiBenedetto became the 22nd president of the club serving from 27 September 2011 to 27 August 2012 and was succeeded by Pallotta. The new intermediate holding company NEEP Roma Holding was 60% owned by American's ""AS Roma SPV LLC"" and the rest (40%) was retained by the creditor of Sensi UniCredit; NEEP in turn owned all shares held previously by Sensi (about 67%) with the rest free float in the stock market. UniCredit later disinvested NEEP Roma Holding to sold to ""AS Roma SPV LLC"" and Pallotta.

The new ownership immediately went into effect by making significant changes in the club hiring Walter Sabatini as director of football and former Spanish international and Barcelona B coach Luis Enrique as manager. The first high-profile player signings from the duo were attacking midfielder Érik Lamela from River Plate forward Bojan from Barcelona goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg from Ajax and unattached defender Gabriel Heinze. The club also sold and released defender John Arne Riise goalkeeper Doni and forwards Jérémy Ménez and Mirko Vučinić. At the financial level the company had recapitalized for more than €100 million the last recapitalization occurring in the early 2000s.

Roma however was eliminated from 2011–12 UEFA Europa League play-off round. After the formal takeover on 18 August Roma bought forward Dani Osvaldo midfielders Miralem Pjanić and Fernando Gago and defender Simon Kjær as well as youngster Fabio Borini which cost the club more than €40 million. In 2012 Pallotta became the new president.

The 2012-13 pre-season started with the June hiring of former manager Zdeněk Zeman. Zeman replaced Luis Enrique who resigned at the end of the 2011–12 season. Enrique's lone season reign had seen the disappointing loss to Slovan Bratislava in the Europa League as well as the inability to qualify for international competitions for the 2012–13 season. Roma eventually finished 7th losing the Europa League chase to rivals Lazio Napoli and Internazionale. Zeman brought back his high-scoring 4–3–3 formation and his hard working ethic which successfully guided former team Pescara to the Serie A. He was however sacked on 2 February 2013. He was replaced by caretaker manager Aurelio Andreazzoli who's reign saw the continuation of a disappointing season with the team ending up in 6th place in Serie A whilst also losing 1–0 to rivals Lazio in the Coppa Italia final. As a result Roma missed out on European competition for the second season in a row. 
Spalletti with Roma in 2009
On 12 June 2013 Pallotta announced that Rudi García had been appointed the new manager of Roma. He enjoyed a fantastic start to his Roma career winning his first ten consecutive games (an all-time Serie A record) including a 2–0 derby win against Lazio a 0–3 victory away to Inter and a 2–0 home win over title rivals Napoli. During this run Roma scored 24 times while conceding just once away to Parma. The 2013–14 season saw one of Roma's best ever in Serie A the club tallying an impressive 85 points and finishing second to Juventus who won the league with a record-breaking 102 points. Roma's defense was significantly better than in previous seasons with only 25 goals conceded and a total of 21 clean sheets including nine in their first ten matches.

In 2014-15 Roma finished second behind Juventus for the second consecutive season after a poor run of form in 2015. At the end of season the club was sanctioned for lose making and breaking UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations.

On 13 January 2016 Garcia was sacked after a run of one win in seven Serie A games. Luciano Spalletti was appointed manager of Roma for his second spell. On 21 February Totti publicly criticised Spalletti due to his own lack of playing-time since returning from injury; as a result he was subsequently dropped by Spalletti for Roma's 5–0 win over Palermo with the decision causing an uproar among the fans and in the media. After their initial disagreements Spalletti began to use Totti as an immediate impact substitute which proved to be an effective decision as the Roma number 10 rediscovered his form and contributed with four goals and an assist after coming off the bench in five consecutive Serie A games; as a result Spalletti was able to lead Roma from a mid-table spot to a third-place finish in Serie A clinching the UEFA Champions League play-off spot.

During summer 2016 Roma lost star midfielder Miralem Pjanić to rivals Juventus in order to improve its financial position.

On 13 June 2017 Eusebio Di Francesco was appointed as Roma manager replacing Spalletti who left for Inter.

Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHL or AHLE) also known as acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis (AHEM) acute necrotizing hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (ANHLE) Weston-Hurst syndrome or Hurst's disease is a hyperacute and frequently fatal form of ADEM. AHL is relatively rare (less than 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature ) it is seen in about 2% of ADEM cases and is characterized by necrotizing vasculitis of venules and hemorrhage and edema. Death is common in the first week and overall mortality is about 70% but increasing evidence points to favorable outcomes after aggressive treatment with corticosteroids immunoglobulins cyclophosphamide and plasma exchange. About 70% of survivors show residual neurological deficits but some survivors have shown surprisingly little deficit considering the magnitude of the white matter affected.

Societies devoted to the care of cultural heritage have been in existence around the world for many years. One early example is the founding in 1877 of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings in Britain to protect the built heritage this society continues to be active today.

The built heritage was at the forefront of the growth of member based organizations in the United States. Preservation Virginia founded in Richmond in 1889 as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities was the United States' first statewide historic preservation group.

Today professional conservators join and take part in the activities of numerous conservation associations and professional organizations with the wider field and within their area of specialization.

These organizations exist to ""support the conservation professionals who preserve our cultural heritage"".

This involves upholding professional standards promoting research and publications providing educational opportunities and fostering the exchange of knowledge among cultural conservators allied professionals and the public.

85,Albert Sidney Johnston,Legacy and honors,"Johnston's tomb in the Texas State Cemetery in Austin Texas
Sculpted by Elisabet Ney

Johnston was survived by his wife Eliza and six children. His wife and five younger children including one born after he went to war chose to live out their days at home in Los Angeles with Eliza's brother Dr. John Strother Griffin. Johnston's eldest son Albert Sidney Jr. (born in Texas) had already followed him into the Confederate States Army.  In 1863 after taking home leave in Los Angeles Albert Jr. was on his way out of San Pedro harbor on a ferry.  While a steamer was taking on passengers from the ferry a wave swamped the smaller boat causing its boilers to explode. Albert Jr. was killed in the accident.

Killed in action General Johnston received the highest praise ever given by the Confederate government; accounts were published on December 20 1862 and thereafter in the Los Angeles ''Star'' of his family's hometown. Johnston Street Hancock Street and Griffin Avenue each in northeast Los Angeles are named after the general and his family who lived in the neighborhood.

Johnston was initially buried in New Orleans. In 1866 a joint resolution of the Texas Legislature was passed to have his body moved and reinterred at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin. The re-interment occurred in 1867. Forty years later the state appointed Elisabet Ney to design a monument and sculpture of him to be erected at the grave site.

The Texas Historical Commission has erected a historical marker near the entrance of what was once Johnston's plantation. An adjacent marker was erected by the San Jacinto Chapter of the Daughters of The Republic of Texas and the Lee Roberts and Davis Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederate States of America.

The University of Texas at Austin has recognized Johnston with a statue on the South Mall.

For example if the ""Moon: max."" circle is 10 cm wide on a monitor viewing it from 10.3 m away will show true representation of the sizes.

Since antiquity the arcminute and arcsecond have been used in astronomy. In the ecliptic coordinate system latitude (β) and longitude (λ); in the horizon system altitude (Alt) and azimuth (Az); and in the equatorial coordinate system declination (δ) are all measured in degrees arcminutes and arcseconds. The principal exception is Right ascension (RA) in equatorial coordinates which is measured in time units of hours minutes and seconds.

The arcsecond is also often used to describe small astronomical angles such as the angular diameters of planets (e.g. the angular diameter of Venus which varies between 10″ and 60″) the proper motion of stars the separation of components of binary star systems and parallax the small change of position of a star in the course of a year or of a solar system body as the Earth rotates. These small angles may also be written in milliarcseconds (mas) or thousandths of an arcsecond. The unit of distance the parsec named from the '''par'''allax of one arc'''sec'''ond was developed for such parallax measurements. It is the distance at which the mean radius of the Earth's orbit would subtend an angle of one arcsecond.

The ESA astrometric space probe Gaia is hoped to measure star positions to 20 microarcseconds (µas) when it begins producing catalog positions sometime after 2016. There are about 1.3 trillion µas in a turn. Currently the best catalog positions of stars actually measured are in terms of milliarcseconds by the U.S. Naval Observatory.

Apart from the Sun the star with the largest angular diameter from Earth is R Doradus a red supergiant with a diameter of 0.05 arcsecond. Because of the effects of atmospheric seeing ground-based telescopes will smear the image of a star to an angular diameter of about 0.5 arcsecond; in poor seeing conditions this increases to 1.5 arcseconds or even more. The dwarf planet Pluto has proven difficult to resolve because its angular diameter is about 0.1 arcsecond.

Space telescopes are not affected by the Earth's atmosphere but are diffraction limited. For example the Hubble space telescope can reach an angular size of stars down to about 0.1″. Techniques exist for improving seeing on the ground. Adaptive optics for example can produce images around 0.05 arcsecond on a 10 m class telescope.

===Cartography===

Minutes (′) and seconds (″) of arc are also used in cartography and navigation. At sea level one minute of arc along the equator or a meridian (indeed any great circle) equals exactly one geographical mile along the Earth's equator or approximately one nautical mile (1852 meters or ≈1.15078 statute miles). A second of arc one sixtieth of this amount is roughly 30 meters or 100 feet. The exact distance varies along meridian arcs because the figure of the Earth is slightly oblate (bulges a third of a percent at the equator).

Positions are traditionally given using degrees minutes and seconds of arcs for latitude the arc north or south of the equator and for longitude the arc east or west of the Prime Meridian. Any position on or above the Earth's reference ellipsoid can be precisely given with this method. However when it is inconvenient to use  base-60 for minutes and seconds positions are frequently expressed as decimal fractional degrees to an equal amount of precision. Degrees given to three decimal places ( of a degree) have about  the precision of degrees-minutes-seconds ( of a degree) and specify locations within about 120 meters or 400 feet.

===Property cadastral surveying===

Related to cartography property boundary surveying using the metes and bounds system relies on fractions of a degree to describe property lines' angles in reference to cardinal directions. A boundary ""mete"" is described with a beginning reference point the cardinal direction North or South followed by an angle less than 90 degrees and a second cardinal direction and a linear distance. The boundary runs the specified linear distance from the beginning point the direction of the distance being determined by rotating the first cardinal direction the specified angle toward the second cardinal direction. For example ''North 65° 39′ 18″ West 85.69 feet'' would describe a line running from the starting point 85.69 feet in a direction 65° 39′ 18″ (or 65.655°) away from north toward the west.

===Firearms===
The arcminute is commonly found in the firearms industry and literature particularly concerning the accuracy of rifles though the industry refers to it as '''minute of angle''' (MOA). It is especially popular with shooters familiar with the imperial measurement system because 1 MOA subtends 1.047 inches at 100 yards (approximately 3 cm at 100 m) a traditional distance on U.S. target ranges. The subtension is linear with the distance for example 500 yards = 5.235 inches and 1000 yards = 10.47 inches. Since many modern telescopic sights are adjustable in half () quarter () or eighth () MOA increments also known as ''clicks'' zeroing and adjustments are made by counting 2 4 and 8 clicks per MOA respectively.

For example if the point of impact is 3 inches high and 1.5 inches left of the point of aim at 100 yards (which for instance could be measured by using a spotting scope with a calibrated reticle) the scope needs to be adjusted 3 MOA down and 1.5 MOA right. Such adjustments are trivial when the scope's adjustment dials have a MOA scale printed on them and even figuring the right number of clicks is relatively easy on scopes that ''click'' in fractions of MOA. This makes zeroing and adjustments much easier:

* To adjust a  MOA scope 3 MOA down and 1.5 MOA right the scope needs to be adjusted 3 × 2 = 6 clicks down and 1.5 x 2 = 3 clicks right
* To adjust a  MOA scope 3 MOA down and 1.5 MOA right the scope needs to be adjusted 3 x 4 = 12 clicks down and 1.5 × 4 = 6 clicks right
* To adjust a  MOA scope 3 MOA down and 1.5 MOA right the scope needs to be adjusted 3 x 8 = 24 clicks down and 1.5 × 8 = 12 clicks right

Another common system of measurement in firearm scopes is the milliradian. Zeroing a mil based scope is easy for users familiar with base ten systems. The most common adjustment value in mil based scopes is  mil (which approximates  MOA).

* To adjust a  mil scope 0.9 mil down and 0.4 mil right the scope needs to be adjusted 9 clicks down and 4 clicks right (which equals approximately 3 and 1.5 MOA respectively).

One thing to be aware of is that some MOA scopes including some higher-end models are calibrated such that an adjustment of 1 MOA on the scope knobs corresponds to exactly 1 inch of impact adjustment on a target at 100 yards rather than the mathematically correct 1.047"". This is commonly known as the Shooter's MOA (SMOA) or Inches Per Hundred Yards (IPHY). While the difference between one true MOA and one SMOA is less than half of an inch even at 1000 yards this error compounds significantly on longer range shots that may require adjustment upwards of 20-30 MOA to compensate for the bullet drop. If a shot requires an adjustment of 20 MOA or more the difference between true MOA and SMOA will add up to 1 inch or more. In competitive target shooting this might mean the difference between a hit and a miss.

The physical group size equivalent to ''m'' minutes of arc can be calculated as follows: group size = tan() × distance. In the example previously given for 1 minute of arc and substituting 3600 inches for 100 yards 3600 tan() ≈ 1.047 inches. In metric units 1 MOA at 100 meters ≈ 2.908 centimeters.

Sometimes a precision firearm's accuracy will be measured in MOA. This simply means that under ideal conditions i.e. no wind match-grade ammo clean barrel and a vise or a benchrest used to eliminate shooter error the gun is capable of producing a group of shots whose center points (center-to-center) fit into a circle the average diameter of circles in several groups can be subtended by that amount of arc. For example a ''1 MOA rifle'' should be capable under ideal conditions of shooting an average 1-inch groups at 100 yards. Most higher-end rifles are warrantied by their manufacturer to shoot under a given MOA threshold (typically 1 MOA or better) with specific ammunition and no error on the shooter's part. For example Remington's M24 Sniper Weapon System is required to shoot 0.8 MOA or better or be rejected.

Rifle manufacturers and gun magazines often refer to this capability as ''sub-MOA'' meaning it shoots under 1 MOA. This means that a single group of 3 to 5 shots at 100 yards or the average of several groups will measure less than 1 MOA between the two furthest shots in the group i.e. all shots fall within 1 MOA. If larger samples are taken (i.e. more shots per group) then group size typically increases however this will ultimately average out. If a rifle was truly a 1 MOA rifle it would be just as likely that two consecutive shots land exactly on top of each other as that they land 1 MOA apart. For 5 shot groups based on 95% confidence a rifle that normally shoots 1 MOA can be expected to shoot groups between 0.58 MOA and 1.47 MOA although the majority of these groups will be under 1 MOA. What this means in practice is if a rifle that shoots 1-inch groups on average at 100 yards shoots a group measuring 0.7 inches followed by a group that is 1.3 inches this is not statistically abnormal.

The Metric System counterpart of the MOA is the milliradian or '''mil''' being equal to one 1000th of the target range laid out on a circle that has the observer as centre and the target range as radius. The number of mils on a full such circle therefore always is equal to 2 ×  × 1000 regardless the target range. Therefore 1 MOA ≈ 0.2908 mil. This means that an object which spans 1 mil on the reticle is at a range that is in meters equal to the object's size in millimeters (e.g. an object of 100 mm @ 1 Milrad is 100 meters away). So there is no conversion factor required contrary to the MOA system.  A reticle with markings (hashes or dots) spaced with a one mil apart (or a fraction of a mil) are collectively called a mil reticle. If the markings are round they are called '''mil-dots'''.

In the table below conversions from mil to metric values are exact (e.g. 0.1 mil equals exactly 1 cm at 100 meters) while conversions of minutes of arc to both metric and imperial values are approximate.

Comparison of milliradian (mil) and minute of arc (moa).



* 1′ at 100 yards equals 22619/ 21600 = 1.04717593 in ≈ 1.047 inches
* 1′ ≈ 0.291 mil (or 2.91 cm at 100 m approximately  3 cm at 100 m)
* 1 mil ≈ 3.44′ so  mil ≈ ′
* 0.1 mil equals exactly 1 cm at 100 m or approximately 0.36 inches at 100 yards

===Human vision===
In humans 20/20 vision is the ability to resolve a spatial pattern separated by a visual angle of one minute of arc.
A 20/20 letter subtends 5 minutes of arc total.

===Materials===
The deviation from parallelism between two surfaces for instance in optical engineering is usually measured in arcminutes or arcseconds.
In addition arcseconds are sometimes used in rocking curve (ω-scan) x ray diffraction measurements of high-quality epitaxial thin films.

855,Anti-realism,In mathematics,"In the philosophy of mathematics realism is the claim that mathematical entities such as 'number' have an observer-independent existence. Empiricism which associates numbers with concrete physical objects and Platonism in which numbers are abstract non-physical entities are the preeminent forms of mathematical realism.

The ""epistemic argument"" against Platonism has been made by Paul Benacerraf and Hartry Field. Platonism posits that mathematical objects are ''abstract'' entities. By general agreement abstract entities cannot interact causally with physical entities (""the truth-values of our mathematical assertions depend on facts involving platonic entities that reside in a realm outside of space-time"") Whilst our knowledge of physical objects is based on our ability to perceive them and therefore to causally interact with them there is no parallel account of how mathematicians come to have knowledge of abstract objects.

Field developed his views into fictionalism. Benacerraf also developed the philosophy of mathematical structuralism according to which there are no mathematical objects. Nonetheless some versions of structuralism are compatible with some versions of realism.

=== Counterarguments ===
Anti-realist arguments hinge on the idea that a satisfactory naturalistic account of thought processes can be given for mathematical reasoning. One line of defense is to maintain that this is false so that mathematical reasoning uses some special intuition that involves contact with the Platonic realm as in the argument given by Sir Roger Penrose.

Another line of defense is to maintain that abstract objects are relevant to mathematical reasoning in a way that is non causal and not analogous to perception. This argument is developed by Jerrold Katz in his book ''Realistic Rationalism''.

A more radical defense is to deny the separation of physical world and the platonic world i.e. the mathematical universe hypothesis. In that case a mathematician's knowledge of mathematics is one mathematical object making contact with another.

819,Ælfheah of Canterbury,Life,"Purportedly born in Weston on the outskirts of Bath Ælfheah became a monk early in life. His birth took place around 953. He first entered the monastery of Deerhurst but then moved to Bath where he became an anchorite. He was noted for his piety and austerity and rose to become abbot of Bath Abbey. The 12th century chronicler William of Malmesbury recorded that Ælfheah was a monk and prior at Glastonbury Abbey but this is not accepted by all historians. Indications are that Ælfheah became abbot at Bath by 982 perhaps as early as around 977. He perhaps shared authority with his predecessor Æscwig after 968.

Probably due to the influence of Dunstan the Archbishop of Canterbury (959–988) Ælfheah was elected Bishop of Winchester in 984 and was consecrated on 19 October that year. While bishop he was largely responsible for the construction of a large organ in the cathedral audible from over a mile (1600 m) away and said to require more than 24 men to operate. He also built and enlarged the city's churches and promoted the cult of Swithun and his own predecessor Æthelwold of Winchester. One act promoting Æthelwold's cult was the translation of Æthelwold's body to a new tomb in the cathedral at Winchester which Ælfheah presided over on 10 September 996.

Following a Viking raid in 994 a peace treaty was agreed with one of the raiders Olaf Tryggvason. Besides receiving danegeld Olaf converted to Christianity and undertook never to raid or fight the English again. Ælfheah may have played a part in the treaty negotiations and it is certain that he confirmed Olaf in his new faith.

In 1006 Ælfheah succeeded Ælfric as Archbishop of Canterbury taking Swithun's head with him as a relic for the new location. He went to Rome in 1007 to receive his pallium—symbol of his status as an archbishop—from Pope John XVIII but was robbed during his journey. While at Canterbury he promoted the cult of Dunstan ordering the writing of the second ''Life of Dunstan'' which Adelard of Ghent composed between 1006 and 1011. He also introduced new practices into the liturgy and was instrumental in the Witenagemot's recognition of Wulfsige of Sherborne as a saint in about 1012.

Ælfheah sent Ælfric of Eynsham to Cerne Abbey to take charge of its monastic school. He was present at the council of May 1008 at which Wulfstan II Archbishop of York preached his ''Sermo Lupi ad Anglos'' (''The Sermon of the Wolf to the English'') castigating the English for their moral failings and blaming the latter for the tribulations afflicting the country.

In 1011 the Danes again raided England and from 8–29 September they laid siege to Canterbury. Aided by the treachery of Ælfmaer whose life Ælfheah had once saved the raiders succeeded in sacking the city. Ælfheah was taken prisoner and held captive for seven months. Godwine (Bishop of Rochester) Leofrun (abbess of St Mildrith's) and the king's reeve Ælfweard were captured also but the abbot of St Augustine's Abbey Ælfmær managed to escape. Canterbury Cathedral was plundered and burned by the Danes following Ælfheah's capture.

875,Angels in art,Christian art,"Winged angels in togas Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore Rome (432-440)

===In the Early Church===
Specific ideas regarding how to portray angels began to develop in the early Church. Since angels are defined as pure spirits
 the lack of a defined form has allowed artists wide latitude for creativity. Daniel 8:15 describes Gabriel as appearing in the ""likeness of man"" and in Daniel 9:21 he is referred to as ""the man Gabriel."" Such anthropomorphic descriptions of an angel are consistent with previous descriptions of angels as in Genesis 19:5. They were usually depicted in the form of young men.

The earliest known Christian image of an angel in the ''Cubicolo dell'Annunziazione'' in the Catacomb of Priscilla which is dated to the middle of the third century is a depiction of the Annunciation in which Gabriel is portrayed without wings. Representations of angels on sarcophagi and on objects such as lamps and reliquaries of that period also show them without wings as for example the angel in the ''Sacrifice of Isaac'' scene in the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus.

In a third-century fresco of the Hebrew children in the furnace in the cemetery of St. Priscilla a dove takes the place of the angel while a fourth-century representation of the same subject in the coemeterium majus substitutes the Hand of God for the heavenly messenger.

The earliest known representation of angels with wings is on what is called the Prince's Sarcophagus discovered at Sarigüzel near Istanbul in the 1930s and attributed to the time of Theodosius I (379-395).  Flying winged angels very often in pairs flanking a central figure or subject are derivations in visual terms from pairs of winged Victories in classical art.

In this same period Saint John Chrysostom explained the significance of angels' wings: ""They manifest a nature's sublimity. That is why Gabriel is represented with wings. Not that angels have wings but that you may know that they leave the heights and the most elevated dwelling to approach human nature. Accordingly the wings attributed to these powers have no other meaning than to indicate the sublimity of their nature.""

From then on Christian art generally represented angels with wings as in the cycle of mosaics in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore (432-440).  Multi-winged angels often with only their face and wings showing drawn from the higher grades of angels especially cherubim and seraphim are derived from Persian art and are usually shown only in heavenly contexts as opposed to performing tasks on earth.  They often appear in the pendentives of domes or semi-domes of churches.

===Byzantine art===
12th century icon of the Archangels Michael and Gabriel wearing the ''loros'' of the Imperial guards.

Angels appear in Byzantine art in mosaics and icons. Artists found some of their inspiration from winged Greek figures such as ""Victory"". They also drew from imperial iconography. Court eunuchs could rise to positions of authority in the Empire. They performed ceremonial functions and served as trusted messengers. Amelia R. Brown points out that legislation under Justinian indicates that many of them came from the Caucasus having light eyes hair and skin as well as the ""comely features and fine bodies"" desired by slave traders.  Those ""castrated in childhood developed a distinctive skeletal structure lacked full masculine musculature body hair and beards...."" As officials they would wear a white tunic decorated with gold. Brown suggests that  ""Byzantine artists drew consciously or not on this iconography of the court eunuch"".

Daniel 10: 5-6 describes an angel as clothed in linen and girt with gold. Angels especially the archangel Michael who were depicted as military-style agents of God came to be shown wearing Late Antique military uniform.  This could be either the normal military dress with a tunic to about the knees armour breastplate and pteruges but also often the specific dress of the bodyguard of the Byzantine Emperor with a long tunic and the ''loros'' a long gold and jewelled  pallium restricted to the Imperial family and their closest guards and in icons to archangels.  The basic military dress it is still worn in pictures into the Baroque period and beyond in the West and up to the present day in Eastern Orthodox icons. Other angels came to be conventionally depicted in long robes.

===Medieval art===
Medieval depictions of angels borrow from the Byzantine. In the French ''Hours of Anne of Brittany'' Gabriel wears a dalmatic. In the later Middle Ages they often wear the vestments of a deacon a cope over a dalmatic especially Gabriel in Annunciation scenes - for example ''The Annunciation'' by Jan van Eyck. This indicated that for all their powers they could not perform the Eucharist and were in this respect outranked by every priest reinforcing the prestige of the clergy.  In Early Christian art white robes were almost invariably adopted sometimes bound with the ""golden girdle"" of Revelation. During the mediæval period senior angels were often clad in every brilliant colour while junior ranks wore white. Early Renaissance painters such as Jan van Eyck and Fra Angelico painted angels with multi-colored wings.  Depictions of angels came to combine medieval notions of beauty with feminine ideals of grace and beauty as in da Panicale's 1435 ''Baptism of Christ''.

===Renaissance art===
Fra Angelico The Annunciation 1437-46
The classical ''erotes'' or ''putto'' re-appeared in art during the Italian Renaissance in both religious and mythological art and is often known in English as a cherub the singular of cherubim actually one of the higher ranks in the Christian angelic hierarchy.  They normally appear in groups and are generally given wings in religious art and are sometimes represented as just a winged head.  They generally are just in attendance except that they may be amusing Christ or John the Baptist as infants in scenes of the Holy Family.

===Victorian art===
In the late 19th century artists' model Jane Burden Morris came to embody an ideal of beauty for Pre-Raphaelite painters. With the use of her long dark hair and features made somewhat more androgynous they created a prototype Victorian angel which would appear in paintings and stained glass windows. Roger Homan notes that Edward Burne-Jones and others used her image often and in different ways creating a new type of angel.

===Antiquity===

Petroglyphs in Gobustan National Park dating back to the 10th millennium BC indicating a thriving culture. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site considered to be of ""outstanding universal value"".
The earliest evidence of human settlement in the territory of Azerbaijan dates back to the late Stone Age and is related to the Guruchay culture of Azokh Cave. The Upper Paleolithic and late Bronze Age cultures are attested in the caves of Tağılar Damcılı Zar Yataq-yeri and in the necropolises of Leylatepe and Saraytepe.

Early settlements included the Scythians in the 9th century BC. Following the Scythians Iranian Medes came to dominate the area to the south of the Aras. The Medes forged a vast empire between 900–700 BC which was integrated into the Achaemenid Empire around 550 BC. The area was conquered by the Achaemenids leading to the spread of Zoroastrianism. Later it became part of Alexander the Great's Empire and its successor the Seleucid Empire. During this period Zoroastrianism spread in the Caucasus and Atropatene. Caucasian Albanians the original inhabitants of northeastern Azerbaijan ruled that area from around the 4th century BC and established an independent kingdom.

===From the Sasanid period to the Safavid period===

The Sasanian Empire turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state in 252 while King Urnayr officially adopted Christianity as the state religion in the 4th century. Despite Sassanid rule Albania remained an entity in the region until the 9th century while fully subordinate to Sassanid Iran and retained its monarchy. Despite being one of the chief vassals of the Sasanian emperor the Albanian king had only a semblance of authority and the Sasanian marzban (military governor) held most civil religious and military authority.

In the first half of the 7th century Caucasian Albania as a vassal of the Sasanians came under nominal Muslim rule due to the Muslim conquest of Persia. The Umayyad Caliphate repulsed both the Sasanians and Byzantines from Transcaucasia and turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state after Christian resistance led by King Javanshir was suppressed in 667.  The power vacuum left by the decline of the Abbasid Caliphate was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the Sallarids Sajids Shaddadids Rawadids and Buyids. At the beginning of the 11th century the territory was gradually seized by waves of Oghuz Turks from Central Asia. The first of these Turkic dynasties established was the Seljuk Empire who entered the area now known as Azerbaijan by 1067.

The pre-Turkic population that lived on the territory of modern Azerbaijan spoke several Indo-European and Caucasian languages among them Armenian
 and an Iranian language Old Azeri which was gradually replaced by a Turkic language the early precursor of the Azerbaijani language of today. Some linguists have also stated that the Tati dialects of Iranian Azerbaijan and the republic of Azerbaijan like those spoken by the Tats are descended from Old Azeri. Locally the possessions of the subsequent Seljuk Empire were ruled by Eldiguzids technically vassals of the Seljuk sultans but sometimes ''de facto'' rulers themselves. Under the Seljuks local poets such as Nizami Ganjavi and Khaqani gave rise to a blossoming of Persian literature on the territory of present-day Azerbaijan.

The next ruling state the Jalairid Sultanate was short-lived and fell as a conquest of Timur.

The local dynasty of the Shirvanshahs became a vassal state of Timur's Empire and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the Golden Horde Tokhtamysh. Following Timur's death two independent and rival states emerged: Kara Koyunlu and Aq Qoyunlu. The Shirvanshahs returned maintaining a high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals from 861 until 1539. During their conquest and persecution by the Safavid dynasty of Iran in 1501 the last dynasty converted to Shi'i Islam the formerly Sunni population as it did over its territories in modern-day Iran as it was battling against the Sunni Ottoman Empire. Despite efforts of the Safavids the Ottomans briefly managed to occupy parts of present-day Azerbaijan twice over the centuries. Also Baku and its environs were briefly managed by the Russians in the early 18th century as a consequence of the Russo-Persian War (1722–23). Despite these very brief intermissions by Safavid Iran's neighboring rivals the land of what is today Azerbaijan remained under intermittent Iranian rule from the earliest advent of the Safavids up to the course of the 19th century.

===Contemporary history===


Territories of the khanates (and sultanates) in the 18th–19th century.

After the Safavids the area was ruled by the Iranian dynasties of Afshar and Zand and briefly by the Qajars until the latter was eventually forced to cede it to the Russian Empire in the course of the 19th century. However self-ruling khanates with various forms of autonomy emerged in the area especially following the collapse of the Zand dynasty and in the early Qajar era. These khanates though often self-ruling were vassals and subjects of the Iranian shah. The khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between Central Asia and the West. From the late 18th century on Imperial Russia switched to a more aggressive geo-political stance towards its two neighbors and rivals to the south namely Iran and the Ottoman Empire. Following a chain of events that started with the re-incorporation of Georgia into Iran in 1795 Russia would now actively contest and battle with the latter over possession of the Caucasus region which was for the most part in the hands of Iran. The successful Russian campaigns in the later stages of the Russo-Persian War (1804–13) were concluded with the Treaty of Gulistan in which the shah's claims to some of the Khanates of the Caucasus were dismissed by Russia on the ground that they had been ''de facto'' independent long before their Russian occupation.

The siege of Ganja Fortress in 1804 during the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813) by Russian forces under the leadership of General Pavel Tsitsianov.
Following Qajar Iran's loss in the 1804–1813 war it was forced to concede suzerainty over most of the khanates along with Georgia and Dagestan to the Russian Empire per the Gulistan treaty.

The area to the north of the river Aras amongst which territory lies the contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan was Iranian territory until it was occupied by Russia in the 19th century. Under the Treaty of Turkmenchay which ended the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828) Qajar Iran was forced to recognize Russian sovereignty over the Erivan Khanate the Nakhchivan Khanate and the remainder of the Lankaran Khanate comprising the last parts of the soil of the contemporary Azerbaijani Republic that were still in Iranian hands. After incorporation of all Caucasian territories from Iran into Russia the new border between the two was set at the Aras River which upon the Soviet Union's disintegration subsequently became part of the border between Iran and the Azerbaijan Republic.

Qajar Iran was forced to cede its Caucasian territories to Russia in the 19th century which thus included the territory of the modern-day Azerbaijan Republic while as a result of that cession the Azerbaijani ethnic group is nowadays parted between two nations: Iran and Azerbaijan. Furthermore the number of ethnic Azerbaijanis in Iran far outnumber those in neighbouring Azerbaijan.

After the collapse of the Russian Empire during World War I the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic was declared constituting what are the present-day republics of Azerbaijan Georgia and Armenia.

It was followed by the March Days massacres that took place between 30 March and 2 April 1918 in the city of Baku and adjacent areas of the Baku Governorate of the Russian Empire. When the republic dissolved in May 1918 the leading Musavat party declared independence as the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR) adopting the name of ""Azerbaijan"" for the new republic; a name that prior to the proclamation of the ADR was solely used to refer to the adjacent northwestern region of contemporary Iran. The ADR was the first modern parliamentary republic in the Muslim world. Among the important accomplishments of the Parliament was the extension of suffrage to women making Azerbaijan the first Muslim nation to grant women equal political rights with men. Another important accomplishment of ADR was the establishment of Baku State University which was the first modern-type university founded in the Muslim East.
Paris Peace Conference in 1919. By March 1920 it was obvious that Soviet Russia would attack Baku. Vladimir Lenin said that the invasion was justified as Soviet Russia could not survive without Baku's oil. Independent Azerbaijan lasted only 23 months until the Bolshevik 11th Soviet Red Army invaded it establishing the Azerbaijan SSR on 28 April 1920. Although the bulk of the newly formed Azerbaijani army was engaged in putting down an Armenian revolt that had just broken out in Karabakh Azerbaijanis did not surrender their brief independence of 1918–20 quickly or easily. As many as 20000 Azerbaijani soldiers died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest.

On 13 October 1921 the Soviet republics of Russia Armenia Azerbaijan and Georgia signed an agreement with Turkey known as the Treaty of Kars. The previously independent Republic of Aras would also become the Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within the Azerbaijan SSR by the treaty of Kars. On the other hand Armenia was awarded the region of Zangezur and Turkey agreed to return Gyumri (then known as Alexandropol).

During World War II Azerbaijan played a crucial role in the strategic energy policy of the Soviet Union with 80 percent of the Soviet Union's oil on the Eastern Front being supplied by Baku. By the Decree of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in February 1942 the commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the oil industry of Azerbaijan were awarded orders and medals. Operation Edelweiss carried out by the German Wehrmacht targeted Baku because of its importance as the energy (petroleum) dynamo of the USSR. A fifth of all Azerbaijanis fought in the Second World War from 1941 to 1945. Approximately 681000 people with over 100000 of them women went to the front while the total population of Azerbaijan was 3.4 million at the time. Some 250000 people from Azerbaijan were killed on the front. More than 130 Azerbaijanis were named Heroes of the Soviet Union. Azerbaijani Major-General Azi Aslanov was twice awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union.

===Independence===
Red Army paratroops during the Black January tragedy in 1990.
Following the politics of ''glasnost'' initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev civil unrest and ethnic strife grew in various regions of the Soviet Union including Nagorno-Karabakh an autonomous region of the Azerbaijan SSR. The disturbances in Azerbaijan in response to Moscow's indifference to already heated conflict resulted in calls for independence and secession which culminated in Black January in Baku. Later in 1990 the Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan SSR dropped the words ""Soviet Socialist"" from the title adopted the Declaration of Sovereignty of the Azerbaijan Republic and restored flag of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic as the state flag. As an consequence of the failed coup that occurred in August in Moscow on 18 October 1991 the Supreme Council of Azerbaijan adopted a Declaration of Independence which was affirmed by a nationwide referendum in December 1991 when the Soviet Union officially ceased to exist on 26 December 1991.

The early years of independence were overshadowed by the Nagorno-Karabakh war with the ethnic Armenian majority of Nagorno-Karabakh backed by Armenia. By the end of hostilities in 1994 Armenians controlled up to 14–16 percent of Azerbaijani territory including Nagorno-Karabakh itself. During the war many atrocities were committed including the massacre at Malibeyli and Gushchular the Garadaghly Agdaban and the Khojaly massacres. Furthermore an estimated 30000 people had been killed and more than a million people had been displaced. Four United Nations Security Council Resolutions (822 853 874 and 884) demand for ""the immediate withdrawal of all Armenian forces from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan."" Many Russians and Armenians left Azerbaijan during the 1990s. According to the 1970 census there were 510000 ethnic Russians and 484000 Armenians in Azerbaijan.

In 1993 democratically elected president Abulfaz Elchibey was overthrown by a military insurrection led by Colonel Surat Huseynov which resulted in the rise to power of the former leader of Soviet Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev. In 1994 Surat Huseynov by that time a prime minister attempted another military coup against Heydar Aliyev but Huseynov was arrested and charged with treason. A year later in 1995 another coup was attempted against Aliyev this time by the commander of the OMON special unit Rovshan Javadov. The coup was averted resulting in the killing of the latter and disbanding of Azerbaijan's OMON units. At the same time the country was tainted by rampant corruption in the governing bureaucracy. In October 1998 Aliyev was reelected for a second term. Despite the much improved economy particularly with the exploitations of Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli oil field and Shah Deniz gas field Aliyev's presidency was criticized due to suspected vote fraud and corruption.

Ilham Aliyev the son of Heydar Aliyev became chairman of the New Azerbaijan Party as well as President of Azerbaijan when his father died in 2003. He was reelected to a third term as president in October 2013.

383,Albertosaurus,Paleoecology,"The Horseshoe Canyon Formation is exposed in its type section at Horseshoe Canyon Alberta
All identifiable fossils of ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' are known from the upper Horseshoe Canyon Formation in Alberta. These younger units of this geologic formation date to the early Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period 70 to 68 Ma (million years ago). Immediately below this formation is the Bearpaw Shale a marine formation representing a section of the Western Interior Seaway. The seaway was receding as the climate cooled and sea levels subsided towards the end of the Cretaceous exposing land that had previously been underwater. It was not a smooth process however and the seaway would periodically rise to cover parts of the region throughout Horseshoe Canyon before finally receding altogether in the years after. Due to the changing sea levels many different environments are represented in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation including offshore and near-shore marine habitats and coastal habitats like lagoons estuaries and tidal flats. Numerous coal seams represent ancient peat swamps. Like most of the other vertebrate fossils from the formation ''Albertosaurus'' remains are found in deposits laid down in the deltas and floodplains of large rivers during the later half of Horseshoe Canyon times.

The fauna of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation is well-known as vertebrate fossils including those of dinosaurs are quite common. Sharks rays sturgeons bowfins gars and the gar-like ''Aspidorhynchus'' made up the fish fauna. Mammals included multituberculates and the marsupial ''Didelphodon''. The saltwater plesiosaur ''Leurospondylus'' has been found in marine sediments in the Horseshoe Canyon while freshwater environments were populated by turtles ''Champsosaurus'' and crocodilians like ''Leidyosuchus'' and ''Stangerochampsa''. Dinosaurs dominate the fauna especially hadrosaurs which make up half of all dinosaurs known including the genera ''Edmontosaurus'' ''Saurolophus'' and ''Hypacrosaurus''. Ceratopsians and ornithomimids were also very common together making up another third of the known fauna. Along with much rarer ankylosaurians and pachycephalosaurs all of these animals would have been prey for a diverse array of carnivorous theropods including troodontids dromaeosaurids and caenagnathids. Intermingled with the ''Albertosaurus'' remains of the Dry Island bonebed the bones of the small theropod ''Albertonykus'' were found. Adult ''Albertosaurus'' were the apex predators in this environment with intermediate niches possibly filled by juvenile albertosaurs.

830,Algebraic extension,Introduction,"
In abstract algebra a field extension ''L''/''K'' is called '''algebraic''' if every element of ''L'' is algebraic over ''K'' i.e. if every element of ''L'' is a root of some non-zero polynomial with coefficients in ''K''. Field extensions that are not algebraic i.e. which contain transcendental elements are called '''transcendental'''.

For example the field extension '''R'''/'''Q''' that is the field of real numbers as an extension of the field of rational numbers is transcendental while the field extensions '''C'''/'''R''' and '''Q'''(√2)/'''Q''' are algebraic where '''C''' is the field of complex numbers.

All transcendental extensions are of infinite degree. This in turn implies that all finite extensions are algebraic. The converse is not true however: there are infinite extensions which are algebraic. For instance the field of all algebraic numbers is an infinite algebraic extension of the rational numbers.

If ''a'' is algebraic over ''K'' then ''K''''a'' the set of all polynomials in ''a'' with coefficients in ''K'' is not only a ring but a field: an algebraic extension of ''K'' which has finite degree over ''K''. The converse is true as well if ''K''''a'' is a field then ''a'' is algebraic over ''K''. In the special case where ''K'' = '''Q''' is the field of rational numbers '''Q'''''a'' is an example of an algebraic number field.

A field with no nontrivial algebraic extensions is called algebraically closed. An example is the field of complex numbers. Every field has an algebraic extension which is algebraically closed (called its algebraic closure) but proving this in general requires some form of the axiom of choice.

An extension ''L''/''K'' is algebraic if and only if every sub ''K''-algebra of ''L'' is a field.

796,Act of Settlement 1701,Introduction,"




'''The Act of Settlement''' is an Act of the Parliament of England that was passed in 1701 to settle the succession to the English and Irish crowns on Protestants only. The next Protestant in line to the throne was the Electress Sophia of Hanover a granddaughter of James VI of Scotland and I of England. After her the crowns would descend only to her non-Roman Catholic heirs.

The act was prompted by the failure of King William III and Queen Mary II as well as of Mary's sister Queen Anne to produce any surviving children and the Roman Catholic religion of all other members of the House of Stuart. The line of Sophia of Hanover was the most junior among the Stuarts but consisted of convinced Protestants. Sophia died on 8 June 1714 before the death of Queen Anne on 1 August 1714. On Queen Anne's death Sophia's son duly became King George I and started the Hanoverian dynasty in Britain.

The act played a key role in the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain. England and Scotland had shared a monarch since 1603 but had remained separately governed countries. The Scottish parliament was more reluctant than the English to abandon the House of Stuart members of which had been Scottish monarchs long before they became English ones. English pressure on Scotland to accept the Act of Settlement was one factor leading to the parliamentary union of the two countries in 1707.

Under the Act of Settlement anyone who became a Roman Catholic or who married one became disqualified to inherit the throne. The act also placed limits on both the role of foreigners in the British government and the power of the monarch with respect to the Parliament of England. Some of those provisions have been altered by subsequent legislation.

Along with the Bill of Rights 1689 the Act of Settlement remains today one of the main constitutional laws governing the succession not only to the throne of the United Kingdom but to those of the other Commonwealth realms whether by assumption or by patriation. The Act of Settlement cannot be altered in any realm except by that realm's own parliament and by convention only with the consent of all the other realms as it touches on the succession to the shared crown.

The original documents are deposited in the Lower Saxon State Archives in Hanover Germany.

Following the Perth Agreement in 2011 legislation amending the act came into effect across the Commonwealth realms on 26 March 2015 and removed the disqualification arising from marriage to a Roman Catholic.

68,Aardvark,Ecology and behavior,"Aardvark resting
Entrance to a burrow
Emerging from a burrow
Aardvarks live for up to 23 years in captivity. Its keen hearing warns it of predators: lions leopards cheetahs hunting dogs hyenas and pythons. Some humans also hunt aardvarks for meat. Aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemies but if all else fails they will strike with their claws tail and shoulders sometimes flipping onto their backs lying motionless except to lash out with all four feet. They are capable of causing substantial damage to unprotected areas of an attacker. They will also dig to escape as they can when pressed dig extremely quickly. Their thick skin also protects them to some extent.

===Feeding===
The aardvark is nocturnal and is a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on ants and termites (formivore); the only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the aardvark cucumber. In fact the cucumber and the aardvark have a symbiotic relationship as they eat the subterranean fruit then defecate the seeds near their burrows which then grow rapidly due to the loose soil and fertile nature of the area. The time spent in the intestine of the aardvark helps the fertility of the seed and the fruit provides needed moisture for the aardvark. They avoid eating the African driver ant and red ants. Due to their stringent diet requirements they require a large range to survive. An aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset and forages over a considerable home range encompassing . While foraging for food the aardvark will keep its nose to the ground and its ears pointed forward which indicates that both smell and hearing are involved in the search for food. They zig-zag as they forage and will usually not repeat a route for 5–8 days as they appear to allow time for the termite nests to recover before feeding on it again.

During a foraging period they will stop and dig a ""V"" shaped trench with their forefeet and then sniff it profusely as a means to explore their location. When a concentration of ants or termites is detected the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators and takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long sticky tongue—as many as 50000 in one night have been recorded. Its claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of a termite or ant mound quickly. It avoids inhaling the dust by sealing the nostrils. When successful the aardvark's long (up to ) tongue licks up the insects; the termites' biting or the ants' stinging attacks are rendered futile by the tough skin. After an aardvark visit at a termite mound other animals will visit to pick up all the leftovers. Termite mounds alone don't provide enough food for the aardvark so they look for termites that are on the move. When these insects move they can form columns  long and these tend to provide easy pickings with little effort exerted by the aardvark. These columns are more common in areas of livestock or other hoofed animals. The trampled grass and dung attract termites from Odontotermes Microtermes and Pseudacanthotermes genera.

On a nightly basis they tend to be more active during the first portion of the night time (20:00-00:00); however they don't seem to prefer bright or dark nights over the other. During adverse weather or if disturbed they will retreat to their burrow systems. They cover between  per night; however some studies have shown that they may traverse as far as  in a night.

===Vocalization===
The aardvark is a rather quiet animal. However it does make soft grunting sounds as it forages and loud grunts as it makes for its tunnel entrance. It makes a bleating sound if frightened. When it is threatened it will make for one of its burrows. If one is not close it will dig a new one rapidly. This new one will be short and require the aardvark to back out when the coast is clear.

===Movement===
The aardvark is known to be a good swimmer and has been witnessed successfully swimming in strong currents. It can dig a yard of tunnel in about five minutes but otherwise moves fairly slowly.

When leaving the burrow at night they pause at the entrance for about ten minutes sniffing and listening. After this period of watchfulness it will bound out and within seconds it will be  away. It will then pause prick its ears twisting its head to listen then jump and move off to start foraging.

Aside from digging out ants and termites the aardvark also excavates burrows in which to live; of which they generally fall into three categories: burrows made while foraging refuge and resting location and permanent homes. Temporary sites are scattered around the home range and are used as refuges while the main burrow is also used for breeding. Main burrows can be deep and extensive have several entrances and can be as long as . These burrows can be large enough for a man to enter. The aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly and periodically moves on and makes a new one. The old burrows are an important part of the African wildlife scene. As they are vacated then they are inhabited by smaller animals like the African wild dog ant-eating chat ''Nycteris thebaica'' and warthogs. Other animals that use them are hares mongooses hyenas owls pythons and lizards. Without these refuges many animals would die during wildfire season. Only mothers and young share burrows; however the aardvark is known to live in small family groups or as a solitary creature. If attacked in the tunnel it will escape by digging out of the tunnel thereby placing the fresh fill between it and its predator or if it decides to fight it will roll onto its back and attack with its claws. The aardvark has been known to sleep in a recently excavated ant nest which also serves as protection from its predators.

===Reproduction===
Aardvark mother and young
Aardvarks pair only during the breeding season; after a gestation period of seven months one cub weighing around  is born during May–July. When born the young has flaccid ears and many wrinkles. When nursing it will nurse off each teat in succession. After two weeks the folds of skin disappear and after three the ears can be held upright. After 5–6 weeks body hair starts growing. It is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks is eating termites at 9 weeks and is weaned between three months and 16 weeks. At six months of age it is able to dig its own burrows but it will often remain with the mother until the next mating season and is sexually mature from approximately two years of age.

Aberdeen Airport (ABZ) at Dyce in the north of the city serves domestic and international destinations including France Germany the Netherlands Spain Belgium Austria Ireland and Scandinavian countries. The heliport which serves the oil industry and rescue services is one of the world's busiest commercial heliports. Aberdeen railway station is on the main UK rail network and Abellio ScotRail has frequent direct trains to major cities such as Edinburgh Glasgow and Inverness. Virgin Trains East Coast and the Caledonian Sleeper operate direct trains to London. The station is being updated to bring it into the modern age. In 2007 additions were made and a new ticket office was built in the building. The UK's longest direct rail journey runs from Aberdeen to Penzance. It is operated by CrossCountry leaving Aberdeen at 08:20 and taking 13 hours and 23 minutes.

Until 2007 a 1950s-style concrete bus station at Guild Street served out-of-the-city locations; it has since transferred to a new and well-presented bus station just 100 metres to the east off Market Street as part of the Union Square development. There are six major roads in and out of the city. The A90 is the main arterial route into the city from the north and south linking Aberdeen to Edinburgh Dundee Brechin and Perth in the south and Ellon Peterhead and Fraserburgh in the north. The A96 links Elgin and Inverness and the north west. The A93 is the main route to the west heading towards Royal Deeside and the Cairngorms. After Braemar it turns south providing an alternative tourist route to Perth. The A944 also heads west through Westhill and on to Alford. The A92 was the original southerly road to Aberdeen prior to the building of the A90 and is now used as a tourist route connecting the towns of Montrose and Arbroath and on the east coast. The A947 exits the city at Dyce and goes on to Newmachar Oldmeldrum and Turriff finally ending at Banff and Macduff.

After first being mooted some 60 years ago and being held up for the past five years by a number of legal challenges Aberdeen's long-awaited Western Peripheral Route was given the go-ahead after campaigners lost their appeal to the UK Supreme Court in October 2012. The  route is earmarked to be completed in 2018 and is hoped to significantly reduce traffic congestion in and around the city. Aberdeen Harbour is important as the largest in the north of Scotland and as a ferry route to Orkney and Shetland. Established in 1136 it has been referred to as the oldest business in Britain.

FirstGroup operates the city buses under the name First Aberdeen as the successor of Grampian Regional Transport (GRT) and Aberdeen Corporation Tramways. Aberdeen is the global headquarters of FirstGroup plc having grown from the GRT Group. First is still based at the former Aberdeen Tramways depot on King Street which has now been redeveloped into a new Global Headquarters and Aberdeen bus depot. Stagecoach East Scotland also run buses in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire under the Stagecoach Bluebird brand. Megabus run buses from the bus station to places north and south of the city.

National Express operate express coach services to London twice daily. The 590 service operated by Bruce's Coaches of Salsburgh
operates in the morning and runs through the day calling at Dundee Perth Glasgow Hamilton Carlisle Milton Keynes Golders Green and Victoria Coach Station whilst the 592 (operated by Parks of Hamilton) leaves in the evening and travels overnight
calling at Dundee Glasgow Hamilton Carlisle Heathrow Airport and Victoria Coach Station.
In addition there are Megabus services to London and Edinburgh and Scottish Citylink services to Glasgow operated by Stagecoach East Scotland and Parks of Hamilton using the Citylink gold and blue livery.

Aberdeen is connected to the UK National Cycle Network and has a track to the south connecting to cities such as Dundee and Edinburgh and one to the north that forks about  from the city into two different tracks heading to Inverness and Fraserburgh respectively. Two popular footpaths along old railway tracks are the Deeside Way to Banchory (which will eventually connect to Ballater) and the Formartine and Buchan Way to Ellon both used by a mixture of cyclists walkers and occasionally horses. Four park-and-ride sites serve the city: Stonehaven and Ellon (approx  out from the city centre) and Kingswells and Bridge of Don (approx  out).

The Dee Estuary Aberdeen's harbour has continually been improved. Starting out as a fishing port moving onto steam trawlers the oil industry it is now a major port of departure for the Baltic and Scandinavia. Major exports include fertiliser granite and chemicals.

863,Armadillo,History and distribution,"Like all of the Xenarthra lineages armadillos originated in South America. Due to the continent's former isolation they were confined there for most of the Cenozoic. The recent formation of the Isthmus of Panama allowed a few members of the family to migrate northward into southern North America by the early Pleistocene as part of the Great American Interchange. (Some of their much larger cingulate relatives the pampatheres and chlamyphorid glyptodonts made the same journey.)

Today all extant armadillo species are still present in South America. They are particularly diverse in Paraguay (where 11 species exist) and surrounding areas. Many species are endangered. Some including four species of ''Dasypus'' are widely distributed over the Americas whereas others such as Yepes's mulita are restricted to small ranges. Two species the northern naked-tailed armadillo and nine-banded armadillo are found in Central America; the latter has also reached the United States primarily in the south-central states (notably Texas) but with a range that extends as far east as South Carolina and Florida and as far north as Nebraska and central Indiana. Their range has consistently expanded in North America over the last century due to a lack of natural predators.

228,Albert Schweitzer,Reverence for life,"
Schweitzer in 1955
The keynote of Schweitzer's personal philosophy (which he considered to be his greatest contribution to mankind) was the idea of ''Reverence for Life'' (""''Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben''""). He thought that Western civilization was decaying because it had abandoned affirmation of life as its ethical foundation.

In the Preface to ''Civilization and Ethics'' (1923) he argued that Western philosophy from Descartes to Kant had set out to explain the objective world expecting that humanity would be found to have a special meaning within it. But no such meaning was found and the rational life-affirming optimism of the Age of Enlightenment began to evaporate. A rift opened between this world-view as material knowledge and the life-view understood as Will expressed in the pessimist philosophies from Schopenhauer onward. Scientific materialism (advanced by Herbert Spencer and Charles Darwin) portrayed an objective world process devoid of ethics entirely an expression of the will-to-live.

Schweitzer wrote ""True philosophy must start from the most immediate and comprehensive fact of consciousness and this may be formulated as follows: 'I am life which wills to live and I exist in the midst of life which wills to live.'"" In nature one form of life must always prey upon another. However human consciousness holds an awareness of and sympathy for the will of other beings to live. An ethical human strives to escape from this contradiction so far as possible.

Though we cannot perfect the endeavour we should strive for it: the will-to-live constantly renews itself for it is both an evolutionary necessity and a spiritual phenomenon. Life and love are rooted in this same principle in a personal spiritual relationship to the universe. Ethics themselves proceed from the need to respect the wish of other beings to exist as one does towards oneself. Even so Schweitzer found many instances in world religions and philosophies in which the principle was denied not least in the European Middle Ages and in the Indian Brahminic philosophy.

For Schweitzer mankind had to accept that objective reality is ethically neutral. It could then affirm a new Enlightenment through spiritual rationalism by giving priority to volition or ethical will as the primary meaning of life. Mankind had to choose to create the moral structures of civilization: the world-view must derive from the life-view not vice versa. Respect for life overcoming coarser impulses and hollow doctrines leads the individual to live in the service of other people and of every living creature. In contemplation of the will-to-life respect for the life of others becomes the highest principle and the defining purpose of humanity.

Such was the theory which Schweitzer sought to put into practice in his own life. According to some authors Schweitzer's thought and specifically his development of reverence for life was influenced by Indian religious thought and in particular the Jain principle of ahimsa or non-violence Albert Schweitzer has noted the contribution of Indian influence in his book ''Indian Thought and Its Development'':

602,Amyntas I of Macedon,Introduction,"
'''Amyntas I''' (Greek: Ἀμύντας Aʹ; 498 BC) was a king of Macedon. He was a son of Alcetas I of Macedon. He married Eurydice and they had a son Alexander.

Amyntas was a vassal of Darius I king of the Persian Achaemenid Empire since 512/511 BC.
The history of Macedonia may be said to begin with Amyntas' reign. He was the first of its rulers to have diplomatic relations with other states.  
In particular he entered into an alliance with Hippias of Athens and when Hippias was driven out of Athens he offered him the territory of Anthemus on the Thermaic Gulf with the object of taking advantage of the feuds between the Greeks. 
Hippias refused the offer and also rejected the offer of Iolcos as Amyntas probably did not control Anthemous at that time but was merely suggesting a plan of joint occupation to Hippias.

747,Apollo 17,Crew,"

Eugene Cernan Ronald Evans and former X-15 pilot Joe Engle were assigned to the backup crew of Apollo 14. Engle flew sixteen X-15 flights three of which exceeded the  border of space. Following the rotation pattern that a backup crew would fly as the prime crew three missions later Cernan Evans and Engle would have flown Apollo 17. Harrison Schmitt served on the backup crew of Apollo 15 and following the crew rotation cycle was slated to fly as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 18. However Apollo 18 was cancelled in September 1970. Following this decision the scientific community pressured NASA to assign a geologist to an Apollo landing as opposed to a pilot trained in geology. In light of this pressure Harrison Schmitt a professional geologist was assigned the Lunar Module Pilot position on Apollo 17.  Scientist-astronaut Curt Michel believed that it was his own decision to resign after it became clear that he would not be given a flight assignment that mobilized this action.

Subsequent to the decision to assign Schmitt to Apollo 17 there remained the question of which crew (the full backup crew of Apollo 15 Dick Gordon Vance Brand and Schmitt or the backup crew of Apollo 14) would become prime crew of the mission. NASA Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton ultimately assigned the backup crew of Apollo 14 (Cernan and Evans) along with Schmitt to the prime crew of Apollo 17.

The Apollo 15 prime crew received the backup assignment since this was to be the last lunar mission and the backup crew would not rotate to another mission. However when the Apollo 15 postage stamp incident became public in early 1972 the crew was reprimanded by NASA and the United States Air Force (they were active duty officers). Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton removed them from flight status and replaced them with Young and Duke from the Apollo 16 prime crew and Roosa from the Apollo 14 prime and Apollo 16 backup crews.

Three white stars above the red bars represent the three crewmen of the mission. The background includes the Moon the planet Saturn and a galaxy or nebula. The wing of the eagle partially overlays the Moon suggesting man's established presence there. The gaze of Apollo and the direction of the eagle's motion embody man's intention to explore further destinations in space.

The patch includes along with the colors of the U.S. flag (red white and blue) the color gold representative of a ""golden age"" of spaceflight that was to begin with Apollo 17. The image of Apollo in the mission insignia is a rendering of the ''Apollo Belvedere'' sculpture. The insignia was designed by Robert McCall with input from the crew.

A clear title to property is one that clearly states any obligation in the deed to the property. It reveals no breaksin the chain of legal ownership. After the records of the property have been traced and the title has been found clear it is sometimes guaranteed or insured. In a few states a different system of insuring title of real properties provides for registration of a clear title with public authorities. After this is accomplished no abstract of title is necessary.

841,Atari ST,Models,"The members of the ST family are listed below in rough chronological order:

; 520ST: Original model with 512 KB RAM external power supply no floppy disk drive. The early models had only a bootstrap ROM and TOS had to be loaded from disk.
; 520ST+: early 520STs with 1 MB of RAM but without floppy disk
; 260ST: originally intended to be a 256 kB variant but actually sold in small quantities in Europe with 512 KB. Used after the release of the 520ST+ to differentiate the cheaper 512 KB models from the 1 MB models. Because the early 520ST's were sold with TOS on disk but this used up 192 KB or RAM so the machine only had around 256KB left.
; 520STM: a 520ST with a built-in modulator for TV output 512 KB RAM.
; 520STFM: a 520STM with a newly redesigned motherboard in a larger case with a built-in floppy disk drive (in some cases a single sided drive only) and 512 KB RAM.
; 1040STF: a 520STFM with 1 MB of RAM and a built-in double-sided floppy disk drive but without RF modulator
; 1040STFM: a 520STFM with 1 MB of RAM and a built-in double-sided floppy disk drive with RF modulator
; Mega ST (MEGA 1 MEGA 2 MEGA 4): redesigned motherboard with 1 2 or 4 MB of RAM respectively in a much improved ""pizza box"" case with a detached keyboard. All MEGA mainboards have a PLCC socket for the BLiTTER chip and some early models did not include the BLiTTER chip. They also included a real-time clock and internal expansion connector. Some early MEGA 2 had a MEGA 4 mainboard with half of the memory chip places unpopulated and the MEGA 2 can be upgraded by adding the additional DRAM chips and some resistors for the control lines. The MEGA 1 mainboards had a redesigned memory chip area and could not be upgraded in this way as there are only places for the 1 MByte DRAM chips.
; 520STE and 1040STE: a 520STFM/1040STFM with enhanced sound a BLiTTER chip and a 4096-color palette in the older 1040 style all-in-one case
; Mega STE: same hardware as 1040STE except for a faster 16 MHz processor with 16K cache an onboard SCSI controller additional faster RS232 port VME expansion port in an ST gray version of the TT case
; STacy: a portable (but definitely not laptop) version of the ST with the complete ST keyboard an LCD screen simulating 640x400 hi-res and a mini-trakball intended mostly for travellers and musicians because of the backlight screen and its built-in midi ports. Originally designed to operate on 12 standard C cell flashlight batteries for portability when Atari finally realized how quickly the machine would use up a set of batteries (especially when rechargeable batteries of the time supplied insufficient power compared to the intended alkalines) they simply glued the lid of the battery compartment shut.
; ST BOOK: a later portable ST more portable than the STacy but sacrificing several features in order to achieve this notably the backlight and internal floppy disk drive. Files were meant to be stored on a small amount (one megabyte) of internal flash memory 'on the road' and transferred using serial or parallel links memory flashcards or external (and externally powered) floppy disk to a desktop ST once back indoors. The screen is highly reflective for the time but still hard to use indoors or in low light it is fixed to the 640 × 400 1-bit mono mode and no external video port was provided. Despite its limitations it gained some popularity particularly amongst musicians.

=== Unreleased ===
; 130ST: intended to be a 128 KB variant. Announced at the 1985 CES alongside the 520ST but never produced.
; 4160STE: as 1040STE but with 4 MB of RAM. Never officially released except a small quantity of development units. Labels were sent out to dealers to affix to machines that had been upgraded to 4 MB.

68,Aardvark,Conservation,"Aardvarks were thought to have declining numbers however this is possibly due to the fact that they are not readily seen. There are no definitive counts because of their nocturnal and secretive habits; however their numbers seem to be stable overall. They are not considered common anywhere in Africa but due to their large range they maintain sufficient numbers. There may be a slight decrease in numbers in eastern northern and western Africa. Southern African numbers are not decreasing. It receives an official designation from the IUCN as least concern. However they are a species in a precarious situation as they are so dependent on such specific food; therefore if a problem arises with the abundance of termites the species as a whole would be affected drastically.

Aardvarks handle captivity well. The first zoo to have one was London Zoo in 1869 which had an animal from South Africa.

418,Abraham,Abraham in religious traditions,"

===Overview===
Abraham is given a high position of respect in three major world faiths Judaism Christianity and Islam. In Judaism he is the founding father of the Covenant the special relationship between the Jewish people and God – a belief which gives the Jews a unique position as the Chosen People of God. In Christianity the Apostle Paul taught that Abraham's faith in God – preceding the Mosaic law – made him the prototype of all believers circumcised and uncircumcised.  The Islamic prophet Muhammad claimed Abraham whose submission to God constituted ''Islam'' as a ""believer before the fact"" and undercut Jewish claims to an exclusive relationship with God and the Covenant.

===Judaism===
In Jewish tradition Abraham is called ''Avraham Avinu'' (אברהם אבינו) ""our father Abraham"" signifying that he is both the biological progenitor of the Jews (including converts according to Jewish tradition) and the father of Judaism the first Jew. His story is read in the weekly Torah reading portions predominantly in the parashot: Lech-Lecha (לֶךְ-לְךָ) Vayeira (וַיֵּרָא) Chayei Sarah (חַיֵּי שָׂרָה) and Toledot (תּוֹלְדֹת).

==== Sefer Yetzirah ====

A cryptic story in the Babylonian Talmud states that ""On the eve of every Shabbat Judah the Prince's pupils Rab Hanina and Rab Hoshaiah who devoted themselves especially to cosmogony used to create a delicious calf by means of the ''Sefer Yetzirah'' and ate it on the Sabbath."" Mystics assert that the biblical patriarch Abraham used the same method to create the calf prepared for the three angels who foretold Sarah's pregnancy in the biblical account at .

===Christianity===
Abraham does not loom so large in Christianity as he does in Judaism and Islam. It is Jesus as the Jewish Messiah who is central to Christianity and the idea of a divine Messiah is what separates Christianity from the other two religions. In Romans 4 Abraham's merit is less his obedience to the divine will than his faith in God's ultimate grace; this faith provides him the merit for God having chosen him for the covenant and the covenant becomes one of faith not obedience. I

The Roman Catholic Church calls Abraham ""our father in Faith"" in the Eucharistic prayer of the Roman Canon recited during the Mass (see ''Abraham in the Catholic liturgy''). He is also commemorated in the calendars of saints of several denominations: on 20 August by the Maronite Church 28 August in the Coptic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East (with the full office for the latter) and on 9 October by the Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. In the introduction to his 15th-century translation of the Golden Legend's account of Abraham William Caxton noted that this patriarch's life was read in church on Quinquagesima Sunday.
He is the patron saint of those in the hospitality industry. The Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates him as the ""Righteous Forefather Abraham"" with two feast days in its liturgical calendar. The first time is on 9 October (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar 9 October falls on 22 October of the modern Gregorian Calendar) where he is commemorated together with his nephew ""Righteous Lot"". The other is on the ""Sunday of the Forefathers"" (two Sundays before Christmas) when he is commemorated together with other ancestors of Jesus. Abraham is also mentioned in the Divine Liturgy of Saint Basil the Great just before the Anaphora and Abraham and Sarah are invoked in the prayers said by the priest over a newly married couple.

===Islam===

Islam regards Abraham as a link in the chain of prophets that begins with Adam and culminates in Muhammad.

Ibrāhīm is mentioned in 35 chapters of the Quran more often than any other biblical personage apart from Moses. He is called both a ''hanif'' (monotheist) and ''muslim'' (one who submits) and Muslims regard him as a prophet and patriarch the archetype of the perfect Muslim and the revered reformer of the Kaaba in Mecca. Islamic traditions consider Ibrāhīm (Abraham) the first Pioneer of Islam (which is also called ''millat Ibrahim'' the ""religion of Abraham"") and that his purpose and mission throughout his life was to proclaim the Oneness of God. In Islam he is referred to as ""Ibrahim Khalilullah"" meaning ""Abraham the Friend of Allah"".

795,Ann Arbor Michigan,History,"

In about 1774 the Potawatomi founded two villages in the area of what is now Ann Arbor.

Ann Arbor was founded in 1824 by land speculators John Allen and Elisha Walker Rumsey. On May 25 1824 the town plat was registered with Wayne County as ""Annarbour;"" this represents the earliest known use of the town's name. Allen and Rumsey decided to name it for their wives both named Ann and for the stands of Bur Oak in the  of land they purchased for $800 from the federal government at $1.25 per acre. The local Ojibwa named the settlement ''kaw-goosh-kaw-nick'' after the sound of Allen's sawmill.

A view of Ann Arbor looking east toward Liberty and State streets showing the Burton Memorial Tower Michigan Theater the former Borders bookstore No. 1 and several buildings of the University of Michigan
Ann Arbor became the seat of Washtenaw County in 1827 and was incorporated as a village in 1833. The Ann Arbor Land Company a group of speculators set aside  of undeveloped land and offered it to the state of Michigan as the site of the state capital but lost the bid to Lansing. In 1837 the property was accepted instead as the site of the University of Michigan which moved from Detroit.

Since the university's establishment in the city in 1837 the histories of the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor have been closely linked. The town became a regional transportation hub in 1839 with the arrival of the Michigan Central Railroad and a north—south railway connecting Ann Arbor to Toledo and other markets to the south was established in 1878. Throughout the 1840s and the 1850s settlers continued to come to Ann Arbor. While the earlier settlers were primarily of British ancestry the newer settlers also consisted of Germans Irish and African-Americans. In 1851 Ann Arbor was chartered as a city though the city showed a drop in population during the Depression of 1873. It was not until the early 1880s that Ann Arbor again saw robust growth with new immigrants coming from Greece Italy Russia and Poland. Ann Arbor saw increased growth in manufacturing particularly in milling. Ann Arbor's Jewish community also grew after the turn of the 20th century and its first and oldest synagogue Beth Israel Congregation was established in 1916.

South University Avenue caters to young people.
During the 1960s and 1970s the city gained a reputation as an important center for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a locus for left-wing activism and anti-Vietnam War movement as well as the student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group Students for a Democratic Society took place in Ann Arbor in 1960; in 1965 the city was home to the first U.S. teach-in against the Vietnam War. During the ensuing 15 years many countercultural and New Left enterprises sprang up and developed large constituencies within the city. These influences washed into municipal politics during the early and mid-1970s when three members of the Human Rights Party (HRP) won city council seats on the strength of the student vote. During their time on the council HRP representatives fought for measures including pioneering antidiscrimination ordinances measures decriminalizing marijuana possession and a rent-control ordinance; many of these remain in effect in modified form. Alongside these liberal and left-wing efforts a small group of conservative institutions were born in Ann Arbor. These include Word of God (established in 1967) a charismatic inter-denominational movement; and the Thomas More Law Center (established in 1999) a religious-conservative advocacy group.

Following a 1956-vote the city of East Ann Arbor merged with Ann Arbor to encompass the eastern sections of the city.

In the past several decades Ann Arbor has grappled with the effects of sharply rising land values gentrification and urban sprawl stretching into outlying countryside. On November 4 2003 voters approved a greenbelt plan under which the city government bought development rights on agricultural parcels of land adjacent to Ann Arbor to preserve them from sprawling development. Since then a vociferous local debate has hinged on how and whether to accommodate and guide development within city limits. Ann Arbor consistently ranks in the ""top places to live"" lists published by various mainstream media outlets every year. In 2008 it was ranked by CNNMoney.com 27th out of 100 ""America's best small cities"". And in 2010 ''Forbes'' listed Ann Arbor as one of the most liveable cities in the United States.

* At birth he was named '''Gaius Octavius''' after his biological father. Historians typically refer to him simply as '''Octavius''' (or Octavian) between his birth in 63 until his adoption by Julius Caesar in 44 BC (after Julius Caesar's death).
* Upon his adoption he took Caesar's name and became '''Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus''' in accordance with Roman adoption naming standards. He quickly dropped ""Octavianus"" from his name and his contemporaries typically referred to him as ""Caesar"" during this period; historians however refer to him as '''Octavian''' between 44 BC and 27 BC.
* In 42 BC Octavian began the ''Temple of Divus Iulius'' or Temple of the Comet Star and added '''Divi Filius''' (''Son of the Divine'') to his name in order to strengthen his political ties to Caesar's former soldiers by following the deification of Caesar becoming '''Gaius Julius Caesar Divi Filius'''.
* In 38 BC Octavian replaced his ''praenomen'' ""Gaius"" and ''nomen'' ""Julius"" with '''Imperator''' the title by which troops hailed their leader after military success officially becoming '''Imperator Caesar Divi Filius'''.
* In 27 BC following his defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra the Roman Senate voted new titles for him officially becoming '''Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus'''. It is the events of 27 BC from which he obtained his traditional name of '''Augustus''' which historians use in reference to him from 27 BC until his death in AD 14.

341,Apocrypha,Examples,"
===Esoteric writings and objects===
The word ""apocryphal"" () was first applied to writings which were kept secret  because they were the vehicles of esoteric knowledge considered too profound or too sacred to be disclosed to anyone other than the initiated. For example the disciples of the Gnostic Prodicus boasted that they possessed the secret () books of Zoroaster. The term in general enjoyed high consideration among the Gnostics (see Acts of Thomas pp. 10 27 44).

Sinologist Anna Seidel refers to texts and even items produced by ancient Chinese sages as apocryphal and studied their uses during Six Dynasties China (A.D. 220 to 589).  These artifacts were used as symbols legitimizing and guaranteeing the Emperor's Heavenly Mandate.  Examples of these include talismans charts writs tallies and registers.  The first examples were stones jade pieces bronze vessels and weapons but came to include talismans and magic diagrams. From their roots in Zhou era China (1066 to 256 B.C.) these items came to be surpassed in value by texts by the Han dynasty (206 B.C. to A.D. 220). Most of these texts have been destroyed as Emperors particularly during the Han dynasty collected these legitimizing objects and proscribed forbade and burnt nearly all of them to prevent them from falling into the hands of political rivals. It is therefore fitting with the Greek root of the word as these texts were obviously hidden away to protect the ruling Emperor from challenges to his status as Heaven's choice as sovereign.

===Writings of questionable value===
""Apocrypha"" was also applied to writings that were hidden not because of their divinity but because of their questionable value to the church. Many in Protestant traditions cite Revelation 22:18–19 as a potential curse for those who attach any canonical authority to extra-biblical writings such as the Apocrypha. However a strict explanation of this text would indicate it was meant for only the Book of Revelation. Rv.22:18–19f. (KJV) states: ""For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book.""  In this case if one holds to a strict hermeneutic the ""words of the prophecy"" do not refer to the Bible as a whole but to Jesus' ''Revelation'' to John.   The early Christian theologian Origen in his ''Commentaries on Matthew'' distinguishes between writings which were read by the churches and apocryphal writings:  (''writing not found on the common and published books in one hand actually found on the secret ones on the other''). The meaning of αποκρυφος is here practically equivalent to ""excluded from the public use of the church"" and prepares the way for an even less favourable use of the word.

===Spurious writings===
In general use the word ""apocrypha"" came to mean ""false spurious bad or heretical."" This meaning also appears in Origen's prologue to his commentary on the Song of Songs of which only the Latin translation survives: ''De scripturis his quae appellantur apocryphae pro eo quod multa in iis corrupta et contra fidem veram inveniuntur a majoribus tradita non placuit iis dari locum nec admitti ad auctoritatem.'' ""Concerning these scriptures which are called apocryphal for the reason that many things are found in them corrupt and against the true faith handed down by the elders it has pleased them that they not be given a place nor be admitted to authority.""

===Other===
Other uses of ''apocrypha'' developed over the history of Western Christianity.  The Gelasian Decree (generally held now as being  the work of an anonymous scholar between 519 and 553) refers to religious works by church fathers Eusebius Tertullian and Clement of Alexandria as apocrypha. Augustine defined the word as meaning simply ""obscurity of origin"" implying that any book of unknown authorship or questionable authenticity would be considered apocryphal. On the other hand Jerome (in ''Protogus Galeatus'') declared that all books outside the Hebrew canon were apocryphal. In practice Jerome treated some books outside the Hebrew canon as if they were canonical and the Western Church did not accept Jerome's definition of apocrypha instead retaining the word's prior meaning (''see: Deuterocanon''). As a result various church authorities labeled different books as apocrypha treating them with varying levels of regard.
 
Origen (who stated that ""the canonical books as the Hebrews have handed them down are twenty-two"") Clement and others cited some apocryphal books as ""scripture"" ""divine scripture"" ""inspired"" and the like. On the other hand teachers connected with Palestine and familiar with the Hebrew canon excluded from the canon all of the Old Testament not found there. This view is reflected in the canon of Melito of Sardis and in the prefaces and letters of Jerome. A third view was that the books were not as valuable as the canonical scriptures of the Hebrew collection but were of value for moral uses as introductory texts for new converts from paganism and to be read in congregations. They were referred to as ""ecclesiastical"" works by Rufinus.

These three opinions regarding the apocryphal books prevailed until the Protestant Reformation when the idea of what constitutes canon became a matter of primary concern for Roman Catholics and Protestants alike. In 1546 the Catholic Council of Trent reconfirmed the canon of Augustine dating to the second and third centuries declaring ""He is also to be anathema who does not receive these entire books with all their parts as they have been accustomed to be read in the Catholic Church and are found in the ancient editions of the Latin Vulgate as sacred and canonical."" The whole of the books in question with the exception of 1 Esdras and 2 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasseh were declared canonical at Trent. The Protestants in comparison  were diverse in their opinion of the deuterocanon early on. Some considered them divinely inspired others rejected them. Anglicans took a position between the Catholic Church and the Protestant Churches; they kept them as Christian intertestamental readings and a part of the Bible but no doctrine should be based on them. John Wycliffe a 14th-century Christian Humanist had declared in his biblical translation that ""whatever book is in the Old Testament besides these twenty-five shall be set among the apocrypha that is without authority or belief."" Nevertheless his translation of the Bible included the apocrypha and the Epistle of the Laodiceans.

Martin Luther did not class apocryphal books as being Scripture but in both the German (1534) and English (1535) translations of the Bible the apocrypha are published in a separate section from the other books although the Lutheran and Anglican lists are different. In some editions (like the Westminster) readers were warned that these books were not ""to be any otherwise approved or made use of than other human writings."" A milder distinction was expressed elsewhere such as in the ""argument"" introducing them in the Geneva Bible and in the Sixth Article of the Church of England where it is said that ""the other books the church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners"" though not to establish doctrine.  Among some other Protestants  the term ''apocryphal'' began to take on extra or altered connotations: not just of dubious authenticity but having spurious or false content not just obscure but having hidden or suspect motives.  Protestants were (and are) not unanimous in adopting those meanings. The Church of England agreed and that view continues today throughout the Lutheran Church the worldwide Anglican Communion and many other denominations.  Whichever implied meaning is intended ''Apocrypha'' was (and is) used primarily by Protestants in reference to the books of questioned canonicity. Catholics and Orthodox sometimes avoid using the term in contexts where it might be disputatious or be misconstrued as yielding on the point of canonicity.  Thus the respect accorded to apocryphal books varied between Protestant denominations. Most Protestant published Bibles that include the apocryphal books will relocate them into a separate section (rather like an appendix) so as not to intermingle them with their canonical books.

According to the Orthodox Anglican Church:


With few exceptions the 66 book Protestantism canon (such as listed in the  Westminster Confession of 1646) has been well established for centuries and with many today contending against the Apocrypha using various arguments.

===Metaphorical usage===

The adjective ''apocryphal'' is commonly used in modern English to refer to any text or story considered to be of dubious veracity or authority although it may contain some moral truth. In this broader metaphorical sense the word suggests a claim that is in the nature of folklore factoid or urban legend.

J Collin de Plancy's ''Dictionnaire Infernal (Infernal Dictionary)'' states that Abraxas (or Abracax) was an anguipede (a deity represented with snake feet) pagan God of ""Asian theogonies"" with a ""rooster's head dragon's feet and a whip in his hand."" De Plancy says that demonologists describe Abraxas as a demon having a ""king's head and snakes in lieu of feet.""

110,Alfred Korzybski,"""To be""","Many devotees and critics of Korzybski reduced his rather complex system to a simple matter of what he said about the verb form ""is"" of the more general verb ""to be."" His system however is based primarily on such terminology as the different ""orders of abstraction"" and formulations such as ""consciousness of abstracting."" It is often said that Korzybski ''opposed'' the use of the verb ""to be."" This is a profound exaggeration (see ""criticisms"" below).

He thought that ''certain uses'' of the verb ""to be"" called the ""is of identity"" and the ""is of predication"" were faulty in structure e.g. a statement such as ""Elizabeth is a fool"" (said of a person named ""Elizabeth"" who has done something that we regard as foolish). In Korzybski's system one's assessment of Elizabeth belongs to a higher order of abstraction than Elizabeth herself. Korzybski's remedy was to ''deny'' identity; in this example to be aware continually that ""Elizabeth"" is ''not'' what we ''call'' her. We find Elizabeth not in the verbal domain the world of words but the nonverbal domain (the two he said amount to different orders of abstraction). This was expressed by Korzybski's most famous premise ""the map is not the territory"". Note that this premise uses the phrase ""is not"" a form of ""to be""; this and many other examples show that he did not intend to abandon ""to be"" as such. In fact he said explicitly that there were no structural problems with the verb ""to be"" when used as an auxiliary verb or when used to state existence or location. It was even acceptable at times to use the faulty forms of the verb ""to be"" as long as one was aware of their structural limitations.

43,Analysis of variance,Generalizations,"ANOVA is considered to be a special case of linear regression which in turn is a special case of the general linear model. All consider the observations to be the sum of a model (fit) and a residual (error) to be minimized.

The Kruskal–Wallis test and the Friedman test are nonparametric tests which  do not rely on an assumption of normality.

===Connection to linear regression===
Below we make clear the connection between multi-way ANOVA and linear regression. Linearly re-order the data so that  observation is associated with a response  and factors  where  denotes the different factors and  is the total number of factors. In one-way ANOVA  and in two-way ANOVA . Furthermore we assume the  factor has  levels. Now we can one-hot encode the factors into the  dimensional vector .

The one-hot encoding function  is defined such that the  entry of  is

The vector  is the concatenation of all of the above vectors for all . Thus . In order to obtain a fully general -way interaction ANOVA we must also concatenate every additional interaction term in the vector  and then add an intercept term.  Let that vector be .

With this notation in place we now have the exact connection with linear regression. We simply regress response  against the vector . However there is a concern about identifiability. In order to overcome such issues we assume that the sum of the parameters within each set of interactions is equal to zero. From here one can use F-statistics or other methods to determine the relevance of the individual factors.

====Example====
We can consider the 2-way interaction example where we assume that the first factor has 2 levels and the second factor has 3 levels.

Define  if  and  if  i.e.  is the one-hot encoding of the first factor and  is the one-hot encoding of the second factor.

With that

where the last term is an intercept term. For a more concrete example suppose that

641,Apuleius,Introduction,"


'''Apuleius''' (; also called '''Lucius Apuleius Madaurensis''' and in  c. 124 – c. 170 AD) was a Latin-language prose writer platonist philosopher and rhetorian. He was a Numidian who lived under the Roman Empire and was from Madauros (now M'Daourouch Algeria). He studied Platonism in Athens travelled to Italy Asia Minor and Egypt and was an initiate in several cults or mysteries. The most famous incident in his life was when he was accused of using magic to gain the attentions (and fortune) of a wealthy widow. He declaimed and then distributed a witty ''tour de force'' in his own defense before the proconsul and a court of magistrates convened in Sabratha near ancient Tripoli Libya. This is known as the ''Apologia''.

His most famous work is his bawdy picaresque novel the ''Metamorphoses'' otherwise known as ''The Golden Ass''. It is the only Latin novel that has survived in its entirety. It relates the ludicrous adventures of one Lucius who experiments with magic and is accidentally turned into a donkey.

139,Anatolia,Introduction,"


The traditional definition of Anatolia within modern Turkey

'''Anatolia''' (Ancient Greek:  '''' from  '''' modern pronunciation '''' – ""east"" or ""(sun)rise""; in modern ) in geography known as '''Asia Minor''' (Ancient Greek:  '''' modern pronunciation '''' – ""small Asia""; in modern ) '''Asian Turkey''' '''Anatolian peninsula''' or '''Anatolian plateau''' is the westernmost protrusion of Asia which makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey. The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north the Mediterranean Sea to the south and the Aegean Sea to the west. The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the European mainland.

Traditionally Anatolia is considered to extend in the east to a line between the Gulf of Alexandretta and the Black Sea to the Armenian Highlands (Armenia Major). This region is now named and largely situated in the Eastern Anatolia Region of the far north east of Turkey and converges with the Lesser Caucasus – an area that was incorporated in the Russian Empire region of Transcaucasia in the 19th century. Thus traditionally Anatolia is the territory that comprises approximately the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey.

Anatolia is often considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey which comprises almost the entire country; its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be the Turkish borders with neighboring Georgia Armenia Azerbaijan Iran Iraq and Syria in clockwise direction.

The ancient inhabitants of Anatolia spoke the now-extinct Anatolian languages which were largely replaced by the Greek language starting from classical antiquity and during the Hellenistic Roman and Byzantine periods. The Turkification of Anatolia began under the Seljuk Empire in the late 11th century and continued under the Ottoman Empire between the early 14th and early 20th centuries. However various non-Turkic languages continue to be spoken by minorities in Anatolia today including Kurdish Assyrian Armenian Arabic Laz Georgian and Greek. Ancient peoples in the region included Galatians Hurrians Scythians Assyrians Medes Persians Hattians Cimmerians Ionian Greeks the Mongols and Arabs.

965,Adhesive,Introduction,"

Nitrocellulose adhesive dispensed from a tube

'''Adhesive''' may be used interchangeably with '''glue''' '''cement''' '''mucilage''' or '''paste''' and is any substance applied to one surface or both surfaces of two separate items that binds them together and resists their separation. Adjectives may be used in conjunction with the word ""adhesive"" to describe properties based on the substance's physical or chemical form the type of materials joined or conditions under which it is applied.

The use of adhesives offers many advantages over binding techniques such as sewing mechanical fastening thermal bonding etc. These include the ability to bind different materials together to distribute stress more efficiently across the joint the cost effectiveness of an easily mechanized process an improvement in aesthetic design and increased design flexibility. Disadvantages of adhesive use include decreased stability at high temperatures relative weakness in bonding large objects with a small bonding surface area and greater difficulty in separating objects during testing. Adhesives are typically organized by the method of adhesion. These are then organized into reactive and non-reactive adhesives which refers to whether the adhesive chemically reacts in order to harden. Alternatively they can be organized by whether the raw stock is of natural or synthetic origin or by their starting physical phase.

Adhesives may be found naturally or produced synthetically. The earliest human use of adhesive-like substances was approximately 200000 years ago. The first references to adhesives in literature first appeared in approximately 2000 BCE. The Greeks and Romans made great contributions to the development of adhesives. In Europe glue was not widely used until the period 1500–1700 CE. From then until the 1900s increases in adhesive use and discovery were relatively gradual. Only since the last century has the development of synthetic adhesives accelerated rapidly and innovation in the field continues to the present.

10,Academy Awards,History,"The first Academy Awards presentation was held on May 16 1929 at a private dinner function at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with an audience of about 270 people. The post-awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel. The cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5 ($ in  dollars). Fifteen statuettes were awarded honoring artists directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time for their works during the 1927–28 period. The ceremony ran for 15 minutes.

Winners were announced to media three months earlier. That was changed for the second ceremony in 1930. Since then for the rest of the first decade the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00 pm on the night of the awards. This method was used until an occasion when the ''Los Angeles Times'' announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result the Academy has since 1941 used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners.

===Institutions===
The first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings for his performances in ''The Last Command'' and ''The Way of All Flesh''. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time the winners were recognized for all of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period and Janet Gaynor later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. With the fourth ceremony however the system changed and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. For the first six ceremonies the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.

At the 29th ceremony held on March 27 1957 the Best Foreign Language Film category was introduced. Until then foreign-language films had been honored with the Special Achievement Award.

The 74th Academy Awards held in 2002 presented the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

Since 1973 all Academy Awards ceremonies have ended with the Academy Award for Best Picture.

Traditionally The actors present the awards for actresses and the actresses present the awards for actors.

96,Amateur astronomy,Introduction,"



Perseid meteor shower.
'''Amateur astronomy''' is a hobby whose participants enjoy watching the sky and the abundance of objects found in it with the unaided eye binoculars or telescopes. Even though scientific research is not their main goal many amateur astronomers make a contribution to astronomy by monitoring variable stars tracking asteroids and discovering transient objects such as comets and novae.

The typical amateur astronomer is one who does not depend on the field of astronomy as a primary source of income or support and does not have a professional degree or advanced academic training in the subject.  Many amateurs are beginners or hobbyists while others have a high degree of experience in astronomy and often assist and work alongside professional astronomers.

Amateur astronomy is usually associated with viewing the night sky when most celestial objects and events are visible but sometimes amateur astronomers also operate during the day for events such as sunspots and solar eclipses.  Amateur astronomers often look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes but common tools for amateur astronomy include portable telescopes and binoculars.

People have studied the sky throughout history in an amateur framework without any formal method of funding.  It is only within about the past century however that professional astronomy has become an activity clearly distinguished from amateur astronomy and other related activities.

124,Arabic,The language of the Quran and its influence on Poetry,"
The Quran introduced a new way of writing to the world. People began studying applying the unique styles they learned from the Quran into not only their own writing but also their culture.The deep level on which the Quran addresses the reader creates a strong bond and connection to the reader's soul. Writers studied the unique structure and format of the Quran in order to identify and apply the figurative devices and their impact on the reader. 

=== Quran's figurative devices ===
The Quran inspired musicality in poetry through the internal rhythm of the verses. The arrangement of words how certain sounds create harmony and the agreement of rhymes create the sense of rhythm within each verse. At times the chapters of the Quran only have the rhythm in common.

The repetition in the Quran introduced the true power and impact repetition can have in poetry. The repetition of certain words and phrases made them appear more firm and explicit in the Quran. The Quran uses constant metaphors of blindness and deafness to imply unbelief. Metaphors were not a new concept to poetry however the strength of extended metaphors was. The explicit imagery in the Quran inspired many poets to include and focus on the feature in their own work. The poet ibn al mu'tazz  wrote a book regarding the figures of speech inspired by his study of the Quran. OPoets such as badr Shakir al sayyab expresses his political opinion in his work through imagery inspired by the forms of more harsher imagery used in the Quran.
The Quran uses figurative devices in order to express the meaning in the most beautiful form possible. The study of the pauses in the Quran as well as other rhetoric allow it to be approached in a multiple ways.

===Structure===
Although the Quran is known for its fluency and harmony the structure can be best described as chaotic. The suras also known as verses of the Quran are not placed in chronological order. The only constant in their structure is that the longest are placed first and shorter ones follow. The topics discussed in the chapter often have no relation to each other and only share their sense of rhyme. The Quran introduces to poetry the idea of abandoning order and scattering narratives throughout the text. Harmony is also present in the sound of the Quran. The elongations and accents present in the Quran create a harmonious flow within the writing. Unique sound of the Quran recited due to the accents create a deeper level of understanding through a deeper emotional connection. 

The Quran is written in a language that is simple and understandable by people. The simplicity of the writing inspired later poets to write in a more clear and clear-cut style. The words of the Quran although unchanged are to this day understandable and frequently used in both formal and informal Arabic. The simplicity of the language makes memorizing and reciting the Quran a slightly easier task.

===Culture and the Quran===
The writer al-Khattabi explains how culture is a required element to create a sense of art in work as well as understand it. He believes that fluency and harmony the Quran possess are not the only elements that make it beautiful and create a bond between the reader and the text. 
While a lot of poetry was deemed comparable to the Quran in that it is equal to or better than the composition of the Quran a debate rose that such statements are not possible because humans are incapable of composing work comparable to the Quran.
Because the structure of the Quran made it difficult for a clear timeline to be seen Hadith were the main source of chronological order. The Hadith were passed down from generation to generation and this tradition became a large resource for understanding the context. Poetry after the Quran began possessing this element of tradition by including ambiguity and background information to be required to understand the meaning. 

After the Quran came down to the people the tradition of memorizing the verses became present. It is believed that the larger amount of the Quran memorized is a sign of a stronger faith. As technology improved overtime hearing recitations of Quran became more available as well as more tools to help memorize the versus. 
The tradition of Love Poetry served as a symbolic representation of a Muslim's desire for a closer contact with their Lord.

While the influence of the Quran on Arabic poetry is explained and defended by numerous writers some writers such as Al- Baqillani believe that poetry and the Quran are in no conceivable way related due to the uniqueness of the Quran. Poetry's imperfections prove his points that that they cannot be compared with the fluency the Quran holds.

=== Arabic and Islam ===
Classical Arabic is the language of poetry and literature (including news); it is also mainly the language of the Quran. At present Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is also used in modernized versions of literary forms of the Quran. Arabic is closely associated with the religion of Islam because the Quran was written in Arabic but it is nevertheless also spoken by other religious groups such as Arab Christians Mizrahi Jews Druze and Iraqi Mandaeans. Most of the world's Muslims do not speak Classical Arabic as their native language but many can read the Quranic script and recite the Quran. Among non-Arab Muslims translations of the Quran are most often accompanied by the original text.

Some Muslims present a monogenesis of languages and claim that the Arabic language was the language revealed by God for the benefit of mankind and the original language as a prototype system of symbolic communication based upon its system of triconsonantal roots spoken by man from which all other languages were derived having first been corrupted. Judaism has a similar account with the Tower of Babel.

499,Alboin,Invasion of Italy,"
=== Foundation of the Duchy of Friuli ===




 ""When Alboin without any hindrance had thence entered the territories of Venetia ... – that is the limits of the city or rather of the fortress of Forum Julii (Cividale) – he began to consider to whom he should especially commit the first of the provinces that he had taken. ... he determined ... to put over the city of Forum Julii and over its whole district his nephew Gisulf ... This Gisulf announced that he would not first undertake the government of the city and people unless Alboin would give him the ""faras"" that is the families or stocks of the Langobards that he himself wished to choose. And this was done""



 '''''Paul the Deacon''''' Historia Langobardorum Book II Ch. 9



The Lombards penetrated into Italy without meeting any resistance from the border troops (''milities limitanei''). The Byzantine military resources available on the spot were scant and of dubious loyalty and the border forts may well have been left unmanned. What seems certain is that archaeological excavations have found no sign of violent confrontation in the sites that have been excavated. This agrees with Paul the Deacon's narrative who speaks of a Lombard takeover in Friuli ""without any hindrance"".

The first town to fall into the Lombards' hands was Forum Iulii (Cividale del Friuli) the seat of the local ''magister militum''. Alboin chose this walled town close to the frontier to be capital of the Duchy of Friuli and made his nephew and shield bearer Gisulf duke of the region with the specific duty of defending the borders from Byzantine or Avar attacks from the east. Gisulf obtained from his uncle the right to choose for his duchy those ''farae'' or clans that he preferred.

Alboin's decision to create a duchy and designate a duke were both important innovations; until then the Lombards had never had dukes or duchies based on a walled town. The innovation adopted was part of Alboin's borrowing of Roman and Ostrogothic administrative models as in Late Antiquity the ''comes civitatis'' (city count) was the main local authority with full administrative powers in his region. But the shift from count (''comes'') to duke (''dux'') and from county (''comitatus'') to duchy (''ducatus'') also signalled the progressive militarization of Italy. The selection of a fortified town as the centre for the new duchy was also an important change from the time in Pannonia for while urbanized settlements had previously been ignored by the Lombards now a considerable part of the nobility settled itself in Forum Iulii a pattern that was repeated regularly by the Lombards in their other duchies.

=== Conquest of Milan ===
From Forum Iulii Alboin next reached Aquileia the most important road junction in the northeast and the administrative capital of Venetia. The imminent arrival of the Lombards had a considerable impact on the city's population; the Patriarch of Aquileia Paulinus fled with his clergy and flock to the island of Grado in Byzantine-controlled territory.

From Aquileia Alboin took the Via Postumia and swept through Venetia taking in rapid succession Tarvisium (Treviso) Vicentia (Vicenza) Verona Brixia (Brescia) and Bergomum (Bergamo). The Lombards faced difficulties only in taking Opitergium (Oderzo) which Alboin decided to avoid as he similarly avoided tackling the main Venetian towns closer to the coast on the Via Annia such as Altinum Patavium (Padova) Mons Silicis (Monselice) Mantua and Cremona. The invasion of Venetia generated a considerable level of turmoil spurring waves of refugees from the Lombard-controlled interior to the Byzantine-held coast often led by their bishops and resulting in new settlements such as Torcello and Heraclia.

Alboin moved west in his march invading the region of Liguria (north-west Italy) and reaching its capital Mediolanum (Milan) on September 3 569 only to find it already abandoned by the ''vicarius Italiae'' (vicar of Italy) the authority entrusted with the administration of the diocese of Annonarian Italy. Archbishop Honoratus his clergy and part of the laity accompanied the ''vicarius Italiae'' to find a safe haven in the Byzantine port of Genua (Genoa). Alboin counted the years of his reign from the capture of Milan when he assumed the title of ''dominus Italiae'' (Lord of Italy). His success also meant the collapse of Byzantine defences in the northern part of the Po plain and large movements of refugees to Byzantine areas.

Several explanations have been advanced to explain the swiftness and ease of the initial Lombard advance in northern Italy. It has been suggested that the towns' doors may have been opened by the betrayal of the Gothic auxiliaries in the Byzantine army but historians generally hold that Lombard success occurred because Italy was not considered by Byzantium as a vital part of the empire especially at a time when the empire was imperilled by the attacks of Avars and Slavs in the Balkans and Sassanids in the east. The Byzantine decision not to contest the Lombard invasion reflects the desire of Justinian's successors to reorient the core of the Empire's polices eastward.

=== Impact of the migration on Annonarian Italy ===
The impact of the Lombard migration on the Late Roman aristocracy was disruptive especially in combination with the Gothic War; the latter conflict had finished in the north only in 562 when the last Gothic stronghold Verona was taken. Many men of means (Paul's ''possessores'') either lost their lives or their goods but the exact extent of the despoliation of the Roman aristocracy is a subject of heated debate. The clergy was also greatly affected. The Lombards were mostly pagans and displayed little respect for the clergy and Church property. Many churchmen left their sees to escape from the Lombards like the two most senior bishops in the north Honoratus and Paulinus. However most of the suffragan bishops in the north sought an accommodation with the Lombards as did in 569 the bishop of Tarvisium Felix when he journeyed to the Piave river to parley with Alboin obtaining respect for the Church and its goods in return for this act of homage. It seems certain that many sees maintained an uninterrupted episcopal succession through the turmoil of the invasion and the following years. The transition was eased by the hostility existing among the northern Italian bishops towards the papacy and the empire due to the religious dispute involving the ""Three-Chapter Controversy"". In Lombard territory churchmen were at least sure to avoid imperial religious persecution.

In the view of Pierre Riché the disappearance of 220 bishops' seats indicates that the Lombard migration was a crippling catastrophe for the Church. Yet according to Walter Pohl the regions directly occupied by Alboin suffered less devastation and had a relatively robust survival rate for towns whereas the occupation of territory by autonomous military bands interested mainly in raiding and looting had a more severe impact with the bishoprics in such places rarely surviving.

=== Siege of Ticinum ===

A modern rendering of Alboin's entrance into Ticinum

The first attested instance of strong resistance to Alboin's migration took place at the town of Ticinum (Pavia) which he started to besiege in 569 and captured only after three years. The town was of strategic importance sitting at the confluence of the rivers Po and Ticino and connected by waterways to Ravenna the capital of Byzantine Italy and the seat of the Praetorian prefecture of Italy. Its fall cut direct communications between the garrisons stationed on the Alpes Maritimae and the Adriatic coast.

Careful to maintain the initiative against the Byzantines by 570 Alboin had taken their last defences in northern Italy except for the coastal areas of Liguria and Venetia and a few isolated inland centres such as Augusta Praetoria (Aosta) Segusio (Susa) and the island of Amacina in the Larius Lucus (Lake Como). During Alboin's kingship the Lombards crossed the Apennines and plundered Tuscia but historians are not in full agreement as to whether this took place under his guidance and if this constituted anything more than raiding. According to Herwig Wolfram it was probably only in 578–579 that Tuscany was conquered but Jörg Jarnut and others believe this began in some form under Alboin although it was not completed by the time of his death.

Alboin's problems in maintaining control over his people worsened during the siege of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy made it difficult for a ruler to exert the same degree of authority over his subjects as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or ''duces'' who led each band (''fara'') of warriors. Additionally the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy as unlike the Ostrogoths they had not entered Italy as ''foederati'' but as enemies of the Empire.

The king's disintegrating authority over his army was also manifested in the invasion of Frankish Burgundy which from 569 or 570 was subject to yearly raids on a major scale. The Lombard attacks were ultimately repelled following Mummolus' victory at Embrun. These attacks had lasting political consequences souring the previously cordial Lombard-Frankish relations and opening the door to an alliance between the Empire and the Franks against the Lombards a coalition agreed to by Guntram in about 571. Alboin is generally thought not to have been behind this invasion but an alternative interpretation of the transalpine raids presented by Gian Piero Bognetti is that Alboin may actually have been involved in the offensive on Guntram as part of an alliance with the Frankish king of Austrasia Sigebert I. This view is met with scepticism by scholars such as Chris Wickham.

The weakening of royal authority may also have resulted in the conquest of much of southern Italy by the Lombards in which modern scholars believe Alboin played no role at all probably taking place in 570 or 571 under the auspices of individual warlords. However it is far from certain that the Lombard takeover occurred during those years as very little is known of Faroald and Zotto's respective rise to power in Spoletium (Spoleto) and Beneventum (Benevento).

664,Allegory,Medieval allegory,"British School 17th century – Portrait of a Lady Called Elizabeth Lady Tanfield. Sometimes the meaning of an allegory can be lost even if art historians suspect that the artwork is an allegory of some kind.

Allegory has an ability to freeze the temporality of a story while infusing it with a spiritual context. Mediaeval thinking accepted allegory as having a ''reality'' underlying any rhetorical or fictional uses. The allegory was as true as the facts of surface appearances. Thus the Papal Bull ''Unam Sanctam'' (1302) presents themes of the unity of Christendom with the pope as its head in which the allegorical details of the metaphors are adduced as facts on which is based a demonstration with the vocabulary of logic: ""''Therefore'' of this one and only Church there is one body and one head—not two heads as if it were a monster... If then the Greeks or others say that they were not committed to the care of Peter and his successors they ''necessarily'' confess that they are not of the sheep of Christ."" This text also demonstrates the frequent use of allegory in religious texts during the Mediaeval Period following the tradition and example of the Bible.

In the late 15th century the enigmatic ''Hypnerotomachia'' with its elaborate woodcut illustrations shows the influence of themed pageants and masques on contemporary allegorical representation as humanist dialectic conveyed them.

The denial of medieval allegory as found in the 11th-century works of Hugh of St Victor and Edward Topsell's ''Historie of Foure-footed Beastes'' (London 1607 1653) and its replacement in the study of nature with methods of categorisation and mathematics by such figures as naturalist John Ray and the astronomer Galileo is thought to mark the beginnings of early modern science.

668,Augustin-Louis Cauchy,Work,"
===Early work===
The genius of Cauchy was illustrated in his simple solution of the problem of Apollonius—describing a circle touching three given circles—which he discovered in 1805 his generalization of Euler's formula on polyhedra in 1811 and in several other elegant problems. More important is his memoir on wave propagation which obtained the Grand Prix of the French Academy of Sciences in 1816. Cauchy's writings covered notable topics including: the theory of series where he developed the notion of convergence and discovered many of the basic formulas for q-series. In the theory of numbers and complex quantities he was the first to define complex numbers as pairs of real numbers. He also wrote on the theory of groups and substitutions the theory of functions differential equations and determinants.

===Wave theory mechanics elasticity===
In the theory of light he worked on Fresnel's wave theory and on the dispersion and polarization of light.  He also contributed significant research in mechanics substituting the notion of the continuity of geometrical displacements for the principle of the continuity of matter. He wrote on the equilibrium of rods and elastic membranes and on waves in elastic media. He introduced a 3 × 3 symmetric matrix of numbers that is now known as the Cauchy stress tensor. In elasticity he originated the theory of stress and his results are nearly as valuable as those of Siméon Poisson.

===Number theory===
Other significant contributions include being the first to prove the Fermat polygonal number theorem.

===Complex functions===
Cauchy is most famous for his single-handed development of complex function theory. The first pivotal theorem proved by Cauchy now known as ''Cauchy's integral theorem'' was the following:

:

where ''f''(''z'') is a complex-valued function holomorphic on and within the non-self-intersecting closed curve ''C'' (contour) lying in the complex plane. The ''contour integral'' is taken along the contour ''C''. The rudiments of this theorem can already be found in a paper that the 24-year-old Cauchy presented to the Académie des Sciences (then still called ""First Class of the Institute"") on August 11 1814. In full form the theorem was given in 1825. The 1825 paper is seen by many as Cauchy's most important contribution to mathematics.

In 1826 Cauchy gave a formal definition of a residue of a function. This concept regards functions that have poles—isolated singularities i.e. points where a function goes to positive or negative infinity. If the complex-valued function ''f''(''z'') can be expanded in the neighborhood  of a singularity ''a'' as

:

where φ(''z'') is analytic (i.e. well-behaved without singularities) then ''f'' is said to have a pole of order ''n'' in the point ''a''. If ''n'' = 1 the pole is called simple.
The coefficient ''B''1 is called by Cauchy the residue of function ''f'' at ''a''. If ''f'' is non-singular at ''a'' then the residue of ''f'' is zero at ''a''. Clearly the residue is in the case of a simple pole equal to
:
where we replaced ''B''1 by the modern notation of the residue.

In 1831 while in Turin Cauchy submitted two papers to the Academy of Sciences of Turin. In the first he proposed the formula now known as Cauchy's integral formula
:
where ''f''(''z'') is analytic on ''C'' and within the region bounded by the contour ''C'' and the complex number ''a'' is somewhere in this region. The contour integral is taken counter-clockwise. Clearly the integrand has a simple pole at ''z'' = ''a''. In the second paper he presented the residue theorem
:
where the sum is over all the ''n'' poles of ''f''(''z'') on and within the contour ''C''. These results of Cauchy's still form the core of complex function theory as it is taught today to physicists and electrical engineers. For quite some time contemporaries of Cauchy ignored his theory believing it to be too complicated. Only in the 1840s the theory started to get response with Pierre-Alphonse Laurent being the first mathematician besides Cauchy making a substantial contribution (his Laurent series published in 1843).

===Cours d'Analyse===

The title page of a textbook by Cauchy. In his book ''Cours d'Analyse'' Cauchy stressed the importance of rigor in analysis. ''Rigor'' in this case meant the rejection of the principle of ''Generality of algebra'' (of earlier authors such as Euler and Lagrange) and its replacement by geometry and infinitesimals. Judith Grabiner wrote Cauchy was ""the man who taught rigorous analysis to all of Europe.""  The book is frequently noted as being the first place that inequalities and  arguments were introduced into Calculus.  Here Cauchy defined continuity as follows: ''The function f(x) is continuous with respect to x between the given limits if between these limits an infinitely small increment in the variable always produces an infinitely small increment in the function itself.''

M. Barany claims that the École mandated the inclusion of infinitesimal methods against Cauchy's better judgement .  Gilain notes that when the portion of the curriculum devoted to ''Analyse Algébrique'' was reduced in 1825 Cauchy insisted on placing the topic of continuous functions (and therefore also infinitesimals) at the beginning of the Differential Calculus . Laugwitz (1989) and Benis-Sinaceur (1973) point out that Cauchy continued to use infinitesimals in his own research as late as 1853.

Cauchy gave an explicit definition of an infinitesimal in terms of a sequence tending to zero.  There has been a vast body of literature written about Cauchy's notion of ""infinitesimally small quantities"" arguing they lead from everything from the usual ""epsilontic"" definitions or to the notions of non-standard analysis. The consensus is that Cauchy omitted or left implicit the important ideas to make clear the precise meaning of the infinitely small quantities he used. 

===Taylor's theorem===
He was the first to prove Taylor's theorem rigorously establishing his well-known form of the remainder. He wrote a textbook (see the illustration) for his students at the École Polytechnique in which he developed the basic theorems of mathematical analysis as rigorously as possible. In this book he gave the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a limit in the form that is still taught. Also Cauchy's well-known test for absolute convergence stems from this book: Cauchy condensation test. In 1829 he defined for the first time a complex function of a complex variable in another textbook. In spite of these Cauchy's own research papers often used intuitive not rigorous methods; thus one of his theorems was exposed to a ""counter-example"" by Abel later fixed by the introduction of the notion of uniform continuity.

===Argument principle stability===
In a paper published in 1855 two years before Cauchy's death he discussed some theorems one of which is similar to the ""Argument Principle"" in many modern textbooks on complex analysis. In modern control theory textbooks the Cauchy argument principle is quite frequently used to derive the Nyquist stability criterion which can be used to predict the stability of negative feedback amplifier and negative feedback control systems. Thus Cauchy's work has a strong impact on both pure mathematics and practical engineering.

===Output===

566,Alfonso II of Asturias,Relations with Charlemagne and the Papacy,"Confronted with heavy fire Alfonso II reached out to Charlemagne's Franks. He sent delegations to Toulouse and Aix-la-Chapelle in 796 797 and 798. These diplomacy efforts may have aimed to strengthen his legitimacy and the government structures of Asturias against ongoing internal unrest——troubles in Galicia——and external attacks of the Ibn Mugait brothers i.e. generals Abd al-Karim and Abd al-Malik.

Alfonso was acknowledged as a king by Charlemagne and the Pope and Asturias as a kingdom for the first time. The king showed an interest in the Frankish cult of Saint Martin of Tours and most notably he encouraged Carolingian Church influence into Asturias. Unsurprisingly during Alfonso's reign the alleged resting-place of St. James was revealed. Alfonso's envoys to Charlemagne's courts may have also dealt with the adoptionist controversy which had brought Bermudo's kingdom into Charlemagne's view. It seems that Carolingian support did much to spur his military raid into Andalusian territory up to Lisbon. The Andalusian city in turn was captured and sacked by his troops in 798.

762,Auschwitz concentration camp,Life in the camps,"

The prisoners' day began at 4:30 am (an hour later in winter) with morning roll call. Dr. Miklós Nyiszli describes roll call as beginning 03:00 and lasting four hours. The weather was cold in Auschwitz at that time of day even in summer. The prisoners were ordered to line up outdoors in rows of five and had to stay there until 07:00 when the SS officers arrived. Meanwhile the guards would force the prisoners to squat for an hour with their hands above their heads or levy punishments such as beatings or detention for infractions such as having a missing button or an improperly cleaned food bowl. The inmates were counted and re-counted. Nyiszli describes how even the dead had to be present at roll call standing supported by their fellow inmates until the ordeal was over. When he was a prisoner in 1944–45 five to ten men were found dead in the barracks each night. The prisoners assigned to Mengele's staff slept in a separate barracks and were awoken at 07:00 for a roll call that only took a few minutes.

After roll call the ''Kommando'' or work details walked to their place of work five abreast wearing striped camp fatigues no underwear and ill-fitting wooden shoes without socks. A prisoner's orchestra (such as the Women's Orchestra of Auschwitz) was forced to play cheerful music as the workers left the camp. ''Kapos'' were responsible for the prisoners' behavior while they worked as was an SS escort. The working day lasted 12 hours during the summer and a little less in the winter. Much of the work took place outdoors at construction sites gravel pits and lumber yards. No rest periods were allowed. One prisoner was assigned to the latrines to measure the time the workers took to empty their bladders and bowels.

Sunday was not a work day but the prisoners did not rest; they were required to clean the barracks and take their weekly shower. Prisoners were allowed to write (in German) to their families on Sundays. Inmates who did not speak German would trade some of their bread to another inmate for help composing their letters. Members of the SS censored the outgoing mail.

A second mandatory roll call took place in the evening. If a prisoner was missing the others had to remain standing in place until he was either found or the reason for his absence discovered regardless of the weather conditions even if it took hours. After roll call individual and collective punishments were meted out depending on what had happened during the day before the prisoners were allowed to retire to their blocks for the night and receive their bread rations and water. Curfew was two or three hours later. The prisoners slept in long rows of wooden bunks lying in and on their clothes and shoes to prevent them from being stolen.

According to Nyiszli ""Eight hundred to a thousand people were crammed into the superimposed compartments of each barracks. Unable to stretch out completely they slept there both lengthwise and crosswise with one man's feet on another's head neck or chest. Stripped of all human dignity they pushed and shoved and bit and kicked each other in an effort to get a few more inches' space on which to sleep a little more comfortably. For they did not have long to sleep"".

The types of prisoners were distinguishable by triangular pieces of cloth called ''Winkel'' sewn onto on their jackets below their prisoner number. Political prisoners had a red triangle Jehovah's Witnesses had purple criminals had green and so on. The nationality of the inmate was indicated by a letter stitched onto the ''Winkel''. Jews had a yellow triangle overlaid by a second ''Winkel'' if they also fit into a second category. Uniquely at Auschwitz prisoners were tattooed with their prisoner number on the chest for Soviet prisoners of war and on the left arm for civilians.

Prisoners received a hot drink in the morning but no breakfast and a thin meatless vegetable soup at noon. In the evening they received a small ration of moldy bread. Most prisoners saved some of the bread for the following morning. Nyiszli notes the daily intake did not exceed 700 calories except for prisoners being subjected to live medical experimentation who were better fed and clothed. Sanitary arrangements were poor with inadequate latrines and a lack of fresh water. In Auschwitz II-Birkenau latrines were not installed until 1943 two years after camp construction began. The camps were infested with vermin such as disease-carrying lice and the inmates suffered and died in epidemics of typhus and other diseases. Noma a bacterial infection occurring among the malnourished was a common cause of death among children in the Gypsy camp.

Block 11
Block 11 of Auschwitz I was the prison within the prison where violators of the numerous rules were punished. Some prisoners were made to spend the nights in standing cells. These cells were about  and held four men; they could do nothing but stand and were forced during the day to work with the other prisoners. Prisoners sentenced to death for attempting to escape were confined in a dark cell and given neither food nor water while being left to die. 

In the basement were the ""dark cells"" which had only a very tiny window and a solid door. Prisoners placed in these cells gradually suffocated as they used up all the oxygen in the cell; sometimes the SS lit a candle in the cell to use up the oxygen more quickly. Many were subjected to hanging with their hands behind their backs for hours even days thus dislocating their shoulder joints.

571,Amaryllis,Habitat,"In areas of its native habitat with mountainous fynbos flowering tends to be suppressed until after bush fires as dense overhead vegetation prevents growth.  In more open sandy areas of the Western Cape the plant flowers annually. Plants tend to be very localized in dense concentrations due to the seeds' large size and heavy weight.  Strong winds shake loose the seeds which fall to ground and immediately start to germinate aided by the first winter rains.

459,Aachen,Culture,"Aachen is also famous for its carnival (Karneval Fasching) in which families dress in colourful costumes

In 1372 Aachen became the first coin-minting city in the world to regularly place an Anno Domini date on a general circulation coin a groschen.

The Scotch-Club in Aachen was the first discothèque; it has been open since 19 October 1959. Klaus Quirini as DJ Heinrich was the first DJ ever.

The thriving Aachen black metal scene is among the most notable in Germany with such bands as Nagelfar The Ruins of Beverast Graupel and Verdunkeln.

The local speciality of Aachen is an originally hard type of sweet bread baked in large flat loaves called ''Aachener Printen''. Unlike ''Lebkuchen'' a German form of gingerbread sweetened with honey ''Printen'' use a syrup made from sugar. Today a soft version is sold under the same name which follows an entirely different recipe.

2,Albedo,Examples of terrestrial albedo effects,"
===Illumination===
Although the albedo–temperature effect is best known in colder whiter regions on Earth the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year-round illumination is greater. The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere varying between three and twelve degrees north. The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination.

===Insolation effects ===
The intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation (solar irradiance); high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation where areas such as the Sahara Desert which also have a relatively high albedo will be hotter due to high insolation.  Tropical and sub-tropical rainforest areas have low albedo and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.

Arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb effectively cooling the Earth. This has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This feedback loop results in a reduced albedo effect.

===Climate and weather===
Albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs. The uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land ice or ocean surfaces can drive weather.

===Albedo–temperature feedback===
When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall a snow–temperature feedback results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo reflecting away sunlight leading to local cooling. In principle if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g. a warm air mass) the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher insolation) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo such as grass or soil the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo increasing local temperatures which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further resulting in still more heating.

===Snow===
Snow albedo is highly variable ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow to about 0.4 for melting snow and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow. Over Antarctica they average a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo positive feedback). Cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.
Hence small errors in albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates which is why it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value over broad regions.

===Small-scale effects===
Albedo works on a smaller scale too. In sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.

=== Solar photovoltaic effects ===
Albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices. For example the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10%. More recently the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms) commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.

===Trees===
Because forests generally have a low albedo (the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis) some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation (or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation). In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect. Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration. The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface causes heating where it condenses acts a strong greenhouse gas and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate 

In seasonally snow-covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. Deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.

Studies by the Hadley Centre have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.

===Water===
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the Fresnel equations (see graph).
Reflectivity of smooth water at 20 °C (refractive index=1.333)
At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner (not diffusely). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small angles of incident light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.

Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the terminator (early morning late afternoon and near the poles). However as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.

Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities. Fresh 'black' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.

===Clouds===
Cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. ""On any given day about half of Earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.""

Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 °C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.

===Aerosol effects===
Aerosols (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth's radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain. As per  the effects are:


* ''Aerosol direct effect.'' Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.
* ''Aerosol indirect effect.'' Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei. Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo increased light scattering and radiative cooling (''first indirect effect'') but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (''second indirect effect'').


===Black carbon===
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m−2 with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m−2. Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.

===Human activities===
Human activities (e.g. deforestation farming and urbanization) change the albedo of various areas around the globe. However quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.

433,Apollo program,Astronauts,"
Apollo 1 crew: Edward H. White command pilot Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee

NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations during the Apollo program was Donald K. ""Deke"" Slayton one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts who was medically grounded in September 1962 due to a heart murmur. Slayton was responsible for making all Gemini and Apollo crew assignments.

Apollo 11 crew who made the first manned landing: commander Neil Armstrong CM pilot Michael Collins and LM pilot Buzz Aldrin
Thirty-two astronauts were assigned to fly missions in the Apollo program. Twenty-four of these left Earth’s orbit and flew around the Moon between December 1968 and December 1972 (three of them twice). Half of the 24 walked on its surface though none of them returned to the Moon after landing once. One of the moonwalkers was a trained geologist. Of the 32 Gus Grissom Edward H. White and Roger Chaffee were killed during a ground test in preparation for their Apollo 1 mission.

The Apollo astronauts were chosen from the Project Mercury and Gemini veterans plus from two later astronaut groups. All missions were commanded by Gemini or Mercury veterans. Crews on all development flights (except the Earth orbit CSM development flights) through the first two landings on Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 included at least two (sometimes three) Gemini veterans. Dr. Harrison Schmitt a geologist was the first NASA scientist astronaut to fly in space and landed on the Moon on the last mission Apollo 17. Schmitt participated in the lunar geology training of all of the Apollo landing crews.

NASA awarded all 32 of these astronauts its highest honor the Distinguished Service Medal given for ""distinguished service ability or courage"" and personal ""contribution representing substantial progress to the NASA mission"". The medals were awarded posthumously to Grissom White and Chaffee in 1969 then to the crews of all missions from Apollo 8 onward. The crew that flew the first Earth orbital test mission Apollo 7 Walter M. Schirra Donn Eisele and Walter Cunningham were awarded the lesser NASA Exceptional Service Medal because of discipline problems with the Flight Director's orders during their flight. The NASA Administrator in October 2008 decided to award them the Distinguished Service Medals by this time posthumously to Schirra and Eisele.

826,AVL tree,Operations,"Read-only operations of an AVL tree involve carrying out the same actions as would be carried out on an unbalanced binary search tree but modifications have to observe and restore the height balance of the subtrees.

===Searching===

Searching for a specific key in an AVL tree can be done the same way as that of a normal unbalanced binary search tree. In order for search to work effectively it has to employ a comparison function which establishes a total order (or at least a total preorder) on the set of keys. The number of comparisons required for successful search is limited by the height  and for unsuccessful search is very close to  so both are in .

===Traversal===

Once a node has been found in an AVL tree the ''next'' or ''previous'' node can be accessed in amortized constant time. Some instances of exploring these ""nearby"" nodes require traversing up to  links (particularly when navigating from the rightmost leaf of the root’s left subtree to the root or from the root to the leftmost leaf of the root’s right subtree; in the AVL tree of figure 1 moving from node P to the ''next but one'' node Q takes 3 steps). However exploring all  nodes of the tree in this manner would visit each link exactly twice: one downward visit to enter the subtree rooted by that node another visit upward to leave that node’s subtree after having explored it. And since there are  links in any tree the amortized cost is  or approximately 2.

===Insert===

When inserting an element into an AVL tree you initially follow the same process as inserting into a Binary Search Tree. More explicitly: In case a preceding search has not been successful the search routine returns the tree itself with indication EMPTY and the new node is inserted as root. Or if the tree has not been empty the search routine returns a node and a direction (left or right) where the returned node does not have a child. Then the node to be inserted is made child of the returned node at the returned direction.

After this insertion it is necessary to check each of the node’s ancestors for consistency with the invariants of AVL trees: this is called ""retracing"". This is achieved by considering the balance factor of each node.

Since with a single insertion the height of an AVL subtree cannot increase by more than one the temporary balance factor of a node after an insertion will be in the range  For each node checked if the temporary balance factor remains in the range from –1 to +1 then only an update of the balance factor and no rotation is necessary. However if the temporary balance factor becomes less than –1 or greater than +1 the subtree rooted at this node is AVL unbalanced and a rotation is needed. The various cases of rotations are described in section Rebalancing.

By inserting the new node Z as a child of node X the height of that subtree Z increases from 0 to 1.

;Invariant of the retracing loop for an insertion
The height of the subtree rooted by Z has increased by 1. It is already in AVL shape.

 for (X = parent(Z); X != null; X = parent(Z)) { // Loop (possibly up to the root)
     // BalanceFactor(X) has to be updated:
     if (Z == right_child(X)) { // The right subtree increases
         if (BalanceFactor(X) > 0) { // X is right-heavy
             // ===> the temporary BalanceFactor(X) == +2
             // ===> rebalancing is required.
             G = parent(X); // Save parent of X around rotations
             if (BalanceFactor(Z)  the temporary BalanceFactor(X) == –2
             // ===> rebalancing is required.
             G = parent(X); // Save parent of X around rotations
             if (BalanceFactor(Z) > 0)      // Left Right Case
                 N = rotate_LeftRight(XZ); // Double rotation: Left(Z) then Right(X)
             else                           // Left Left Case
                 N = rotate_Right(XZ);     // Single rotation Right(X)
             // After rotation adapt parent link
         }
         else {
             if (BalanceFactor(X) > 0) {
                 BalanceFactor(X) = 0; // Z’s height increase is absorbed at X.
                 break; // Leave the loop
             }
             BalanceFactor(X) = –1;
             Z=X; // Height(Z) increases by 1
             continue;
         }
     }
     // After a rotation adapt parent link:
     // N is the new root of the rotated subtree
     // Height does not change: Height(N) == old Height(X)
     parent(N) = G;
     if (G != null) {
         if (X == left_child(G))
             left_child(G) = N;
         else
             right_child(G) = N;
         break;
     }
     else {
         tree->root = N; // N is the new root of the total tree
         break;
     }
 
     // There is no fall thru only break; or continue;
 }
 // Unless loop is left via break the height of the total tree increases by 1.

In order to update the balance factors of all nodes first observe that all nodes requiring correction lie from child to parent along the path of the inserted leaf. If the above procedure is applied to nodes along this path starting from the leaf then every node in the tree will again have a balance factor of −1 0 or 1.

The retracing can stop if the balance factor becomes 0 implying that the height of that subtree remains unchanged.

If the balance factor becomes ±1 then the height of the subtree increases by one and the retracing needs to continue.

If the balance factor temporarily becomes ±2 this has to be repaired by an appropriate rotation after which the subtree has the same height as before (and its root the balance factor 0).

The time required is  for lookup plus a maximum of  retracing levels ( on average) on the way back to the root so the operation can be completed in  time.

===Delete===
The preliminary steps for deleting a node are described in section Binary search tree#Deletion.
There the effective deletion of the subject node or the replacement node decreases the height of the corresponding child tree either from 1 to 0 or from 2 to 1 if that node had a child.

Starting at this subtree it is necessary to check each of the ancestors for consistency with the invariants of AVL trees. This is called ""retracing"".

Since with a single deletion the height of an AVL subtree cannot decrease by more than one the temporary balance factor of a node will be in the range from −2 to +2.
If the balance factor remains in the range from −1 to +1 it can be adjusted in accord with the AVL rules. If it becomes ±2 then the subtree is unbalanced and needs to be rotated. The various cases of rotations are described in section Rebalancing.

;Invariant of the retracing loop for a deletion
The height of the subtree rooted by N has decreased by 1. It is already in AVL shape.

 for (X = parent(N); X != null; X = G) { // Loop (possibly up to the root)
     G = parent(X); // Save parent of X around rotations
     // BalanceFactor(X) has not yet been updated!
     if (N == left_child(X)) { // the left subtree decreases
         if (BalanceFactor(X) > 0) { // X is right-heavy
             // ===> the temporary BalanceFactor(X) == +2
             // ===> rebalancing is required.
             Z = right_child(X); // Sibling of N (higher by 2)
             b = BalanceFactor(Z);
             if (b  the temporary BalanceFactor(X) == –2
             // ===> rebalancing is required.
             Z = left_child(X); // Sibling of N (higher by 2)
             b = BalanceFactor(Z);
             if (b > 0)                     // Left Right Case
                 N = rotate_LeftRight(XZ); // Double rotation: Left(Z) then Right(X)
                else                        // Left Left Case
                 N = rotate_Right(XZ);     // Single rotation Right(X)
             // After rotation adapt parent link
         }
         else {
             if (BalanceFactor(X) == 0) {
                 BalanceFactor(X) = –1; // N’s height decrease is absorbed at X.
                 break; // Leave the loop
             }
             N = X;
             BalanceFactor(N) = 0; // Height(N) decreases by 1
             continue;
         }
     }
     // After a rotation adapt parent link:
     // N is the new root of the rotated subtree
     parent(N) = G;
     if (G != null) {
         if (X == left_child(G))
             left_child(G) = N;
         else
             right_child(G) = N;
         if (b == 0)
             break; // Height does not change: Leave the loop
     }
     else {
         tree->root = N; // N is the new root of the total tree
         continue;
     }
     // Height(N) decreases by 1 (== old Height(X)-1)
 }
 // Unless loop is left via break the height of the total tree decreases by 1.

The retracing can stop if the balance factor becomes ±1 meaning that the height of that subtree remains unchanged.

If the balance factor becomes 0 then the height of the subtree decreases by one and the retracing needs to continue.

If the balance factor temporarily becomes ±2 this has to be repaired by an appropriate rotation. It depends on the balance factor of the sibling Z (the higher child tree) whether the height of the subtree decreases by one or does not change (the latter if Z has the balance factor 0).

The time required is  for lookup plus a maximum of  retracing levels ( on average) on the way back to the root so the operation can be completed in  time.

===Set operations and bulk operations===
In addition to the single-element insert delete and lookup operations several set operations have been defined on AVL trees: union intersection and set difference. Then fast ''bulk'' operations on insertions or deletions can be implemented based on these set functions. These set operations rely on two helper operations ''Split'' and ''Join''. With the new operations the implementation of AVL trees can be more efficient and highly-parallelizable.

*''Join'': The function ''Join'' is on two AVL trees  and  and a key  will return a tree containing all elements in   as well as . It requires  to be greater than all keys in  and smaller than all keys in . If the two trees differ by height at most one ''Join'' simply create a new node with left subtree  root  and right subtree . Otherwise suppose that  is higher than  for more than one (the other case is symmetric). ''Join'' follows the right spine of  until a node  which is balanced with . At this point a new node with left child  root  and right child  is created to replace c. The new node satisfies the AVL invariant and its height is one greater than . The increase in height can increase the height of its ancestors possibly invalidating the AVL invariant of those nodes. This can be fixed either with a double rotation if invalid at the parent or a single left rotation if invalid higher in the tree in both cases restoring the height for any further ancestor nodes. ''Join'' will therefore require at most two rotations. The cost of this function is the difference of the heights between the two input trees.
*''Split'': To split an AVL tree into two smaller trees those smaller than key ''x'' and those larger than key ''x'' first draw a path from the root by inserting ''x'' into the AVL. After this insertion all values less than ''x'' will be found  on the left of the path and all values greater than ''x'' will be found on the right. By applying ''Join'' all the subtrees on the left side are merged bottom-up using keys on the path as intermediate nodes from bottom to top to form the left tree and the right part is asymmetric. The cost of ''Split'' is order of  the height of the tree.

The union of two AVLs  and  representing sets  and  is an AVL  that represents . The following recursive function computes this union:

 '''function''' union(t1 t2):
     '''if''' t1 = nil:
         '''return''' t2
     '''if''' t2 = nil:
         '''return''' t1
     t t> ← split t2 on t1.root
     '''return''' join(t1.rootunion(left(t1) t)union(right(t1) t>))

Here ''Split'' is presumed to return two trees: one holding the keys less its input key one holding the greater keys. (The algorithm is non-destructive but an in-place destructive version exists as well.)

The algorithm for intersection or difference is similar but requires the ''Join2'' helper routine that is the same as ''Join'' but without the middle key. Based on the new functions for union intersection or difference either one key or multiple keys can be inserted to or deleted from the AVL tree. Since ''Split'' calls ''Join'' but does not deal with the balancing criteria of AVL trees directly such an implementation is usually called the ""join-based"" implementation.

The complexity of each of union intersection and difference is  for AVLs of sizes  and . More importantly since the recursive calls to union intersection or difference are independent of each other they can be executed in parallel with a parallel depth . When  the join-based implementation has the same computational DAG as single-element insertion and deletion.

65,Andrei Tarkovsky,''Concentrate'',"'''''Concentrate''''' ( ''Konsentrat'') is a never-filmed 1958 screenplay by Russian film director Andrei Tarkovsky. The screenplay is based on Tarkovsky's year in the taiga as a member of a research expedition prior to his enrollment in film school.

===Plot===
''Concentrate'' is about the leader of a geological expedition who waits for the boat that brings back the concentrates collected by the expedition. The expedition is surrounded by mystery and its purpose is a state secret. This screenplay refers to Tarkovsky's year in the taiga where he was a member of a research expedition prior to enrolling at the film school.

===Background===
Although some authors claim that the screenplay was filmed according to Marina Tarkovskaya Tarkovsky's sister (and wife of Aleksandr Gordon a fellow student of Tarvosky during his film school years) the screenplay was never filmed. Tarkovsky wrote the screenplay during his entrance examination at the State Institute of Cinematography (VGIK) in a single sitting. He earned the highest possible grade excellent () for this work. In 1994 fragments of the ''Concentrate'' were filmed and used in the documentary ''Andrei Tarkovsky's Taiga Summer'' by Marina Tarkovskaya and Aleksandr Gordon.

198,Alps,Passes,"''Teufelsbrücke'' (Devil's Bridge) at the Gotthard Pass; the currently used bridge from 1958 over the first drivable bridge from 1830.


The Alps have been crossed for war and commerce and by pilgrims students and tourists. Crossing routes by road train or foot are known as ''passes'' and usually consist of depressions in the mountains in which a valley leads from the plains and hilly pre-mountainous zones. In the medieval period hospices were established by religious orders at the summits of many of the main passes. The most important passes are the Col de l'Iseran (the highest) the Brenner Pass the Mont-Cenis the Great St. Bernard Pass the Col de Tende the Gotthard Pass the Semmering Pass the Simplon Pass and the Stelvio Pass.
Crossing the Italian-Austrian border the Brenner Pass separates the Ötztal Alps and Zillertal Alps and has been in use as a trading route since the 14th century. The lowest of the Alpine passes at  the Semmering crosses from Lower Austria to Styria; since the 12th century when a hospice was built there it has seen continuous use. A railroad with a tunnel  long was built along the route of the pass in the mid-19th century. With a summit of  the Great St. Bernard Pass is one of the highest in the Alps crossing the Italian-Swiss border east of the Pennine Alps along the flanks of Mont Blanc. The pass was used by Napoleon Bonaparte to cross 40000 troops in 1800. 
The col du Mont-Cenis (2081m) at the centre left of the picture gives access to a large alpine lake and further away to the Italian peninsula 10 kilometres beyond the pass.
The Mont Cenis pass has been a major commercial and military road between Western Europe and Italy. The pass was crossed by many troops on their way to the Italian peninsula. From Constantine I Pepin the Short and Charlemagne to Henry IV Napoléon and more recently the German Gebirgsjägers during World War II.
Now the pass has been supplanted by the Fréjus Road (opened 1980) and Rail Tunnel (opened 1871).

The Saint Gotthard Pass crosses from Central Switzerland to Ticino; in 1882 the  long Saint Gotthard Railway Tunnel was opened connecting Lucerne in Switzerland with Milan in Italy. 98 years later followed Gotthard Road Tunnel ( long) connecting the A2 motorway in Göschenen on the German-Swiss side with Airolo on the Italian-Swiss side exactly like the railway tunnel. On 1 June 2016 the world's longest railway tunnel the Gotthard Base Tunnel was opened which connects Erstfeld in canton of Uri with Bodio in canton of Ticino by two single tubes of . It is the first tunnel which traverses the Alps on ground level. From 11 December 2016 it will be part of the official railway timetable for 2017 and be used hourly as standard way to ride between Basel/Luzern/Zurich and Bellinzona/Lugano/Milano.

The highest pass in the alps is the col de l'Iseran in Savoy (France) at  followed by  the Stelvio Pass in northern Italy at ; the road was built in the 1820s.

8,An American in Paris,Preservation status,"
On September 22 2013 it was announced that a musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score will be eventually released. The Gershwin family working in conjunction with the Library of Congress and the University of Michigan are working to make scores available to the public that represent Gershwin's true intent. It is unknown if the critical score will include the four minutes of material Gershwin later deleted from the work (such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section) or if the score will document changes in the orchestration during Gershwin's composition process.

The score to ''An American in Paris'' is currently scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released. The entire project may take 30 to 40 years to complete but ''An American in Paris'' will be an early volume in the series.

Two urtext editions of the work have been published by the German publisher B-Note Music in 2015. The changes made by Campbell-Watson have been withdrawn in both editions. In the extended urtext 120 bars of music have been re-integrated. Conductor Walter Damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance.

89,Actinopterygii,Reproduction,"Three-spined stickleback males (red belly) build nests and compete to attract females to lay eggs in them. Males then defend and fan the eggs. Painting by Alexander Francis Lydon 1879
In nearly all ray-finned fish the sexes are separate and in most species the females spawn eggs that are fertilized externally typically with the male inseminating the eggs after they are laid. Development then proceeds with a free-swimming larval stage. However other patterns of ontogeny exist with one of the commonest being sequential hermaphroditism. In most cases this involves protogyny fish starting life as females and converting to males at some stage triggered by some internal or external factor. This may be advantageous as females become less prolific as they age while male fecundity increases with age. Protandry where a fish converts from male to female is much less common than protogyny.
Most families use external rather than internal fertilization. Of the oviparous teleosts most (79%) do not provide parental care. Viviparity ovoviviparity or some form of parental care for eggs whether by the male the female or both parents is seen in a significant fraction (21%) of the 422 teleost families; no care is likely the ancestral condition. Viviparity is relatively rare and is found in about 6% of teleost species; male care is far more common than female care. Male territoriality ""preadapts"" a species for evolving male parental care.

There are a few examples of fish that self-fertilise. The mangrove rivulus is an amphibious simultaneous hermaphrodite producing both eggs and spawn and having internal fertilisation. This mode of reproduction may be related to the fish's habit of spending long periods out of water in the mangrove forests it inhabits. Males are occasionally produced at temperatures below  and can fertilise eggs that are then spawned by the female. This maintains genetic variability in a species that is otherwise highly inbred.

1032,Alexander Kerensky,Early life and activism,"Alexander Kerensky was born in Simbirsk (now Ulyanovsk) on the Volga River on 4 May 1881. His father Fyodor Kerensky was a teacher and director of the local gymnasium and was later promoted to Inspector of public schools. His mother Nadezhda's father was head of the Topographical Bureau of the Kazan Military District and her mother also first-named Nadezhda (meaning ""Hope""; her patronymic last or ""maiden"" name was Kalmykova) was the daughter of a former serf who had had to purchase his freedom before serfdom was abolished in 1861. He subsequently embarked upon a mercantile career in which he prospered allowing him to move his business to Moscow where he continued his success becoming a wealthy Moscow merchant.

Kerensky's father was the teacher of Vladimir Ulyanov (Lenin) and members of the Kerensky and Ulyanov families were friends. In 1889 when Kerensky was eight the family moved to Tashkent where his father had been appointed the main inspector of public schools (superintendent). Alexander graduated with honours in 1899. The same year he entered St. Petersburg University where he studied history and philology. The next year he switched to law. He earned his law degree in 1904 and married Olga Lvovna Baranovskaya the daughter of a Russian general the same year. Kerensky joined the Narodnik movement and worked as a legal counsel to victims of the Revolution of 1905. At the end of 1904 he was jailed on suspicion of belonging to a militant group. Afterwards he gained a reputation for his work as a defence lawyer in a number of political trials of revolutionaries.

In 1912 Kerensky became widely known when he visited the goldfields at the Lena River and published material about the Lena Minefields incident. In the same year Kerensky was elected to the Fourth Duma as a member of the Trudoviks a moderate non-Marxist labour party founded by Alexis Aladin that was associated with the Socialist-Revolutionary Party and joined a Freemason society uniting the anti-monarchy forces that strived for the democratic renewal of Russia. He was a brilliant orator and skilled parliamentary leader of the socialist opposition to the government of Tsar Nicholas II.
On May 28 1914 Kerensky appealed to Rodzianko with a request from the Council of elders to inform the Tsar that to succeed in war he must:
1) change his domestic policy
2) proclaim a General Amnesty for political prisoners
3) restore the Constitution of Finland
4) declare the autonomy of Poland
5) provide national minorities autonomy in the field of culture
6) abolish restrictions against Jews
7) end religious intolerance
8) stop the harassment of legal trade union organizations.

751,Alpha Centauri,Observation,"

The two Alpha Centauri AB binary stars are too close together to be resolved by the naked eye because the angular separation varies between 2 and 22 arcsec (the naked eye has a resolution of 60 arcsec) but through much of the orbit both are easily resolved in binoculars or small  telescopes.

In the southern hemisphere Alpha Centauri forms the outer star of ''The Pointers'' or ''The Southern Pointers'' so called because the line through Beta Centauri (Hadar/Agena)
some 4.5° west points directly to the constellation Crux—the Southern Cross. The Pointers easily distinguish the true Southern Cross from the fainter asterism known as the False Cross.

The two bright stars at the lower right are Alpha (right) and Beta Centauri (left above antenna). A line drawn through them points to the four bright stars of the Southern Cross just to the right of the dome of La Silla Observatory.

South of about 29° S latitude Alpha Centauri is circumpolar and never sets below the horizon. Both stars including Crux are too far south to be visible for mid-latitude northern observers. Below about 29° N latitude to the equator (roughly Hermosillo Chihuahua City in Mexico Galveston Texas Ocala Florida and Lanzarote the Canary Islands of Spain) during the northern summer Alpha Centauri lies close to the southern horizon. The star culminates each year at midnight on 24 April or 9 p.m. on 8 June.

As seen from Earth Proxima Centauri is 2.2° southwest from Alpha Centauri AB. This is about four times the angular diameter of the Full Moon and almost exactly half the distance between Alpha Centauri AB and Beta Centauri. Proxima usually appears as a deep-red star of an apparent visual magnitude of 11.1 in a sparsely populated star field requiring moderately sized telescopes to see. Listed as V645 Cen in the ''General Catalogue of Variable Stars (G.C.V.S.) Version 4.2'' this UV Ceti-type flare star can unexpectedly brighten rapidly by as much as 0.6 magnitudes at visual wavelengths then fade after only a few minutes. Some amateur and professional astronomers regularly monitor for outbursts using either optical or radio telescopes. In August 2015 the largest recorded flares of the star occurred with the star becoming 8.3 times brighter than normal on August 13.

29,Andre Agassi,Playing style,"Early in his career Agassi would look to end points quickly by playing first-strike tennis typically by inducing a weak return with a deep hard shot and then playing a winner at an extreme angle. His groundstrokes return of serve baseline game anticipation and eye–hand coordination were always among the best in the game. On the rare occasion that he charged the net Agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for the winner. His favored groundstroke was his flat accurate two-handed backhand hit well cross-court but in particular down the line. His forehand was nearly as strong in particular his inside-out forehand to the ad court.

Agassi's strength was in dictating play from the back of the court. While he was growing up his father and Nick Bollettieri trained him in this way. When in control of a point Agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors and to make his opponent run more. This change to more methodical less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach Brad Gilbert in their first year together in 1994. Gilbert encouraged Agassi to wear out opponents with his deep flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars and noted Agassi's two-handed backhand down the line as his very best shot. A signature play later in his career was a change up drop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes. This would often be followed by a passing shot or lob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it.

Agassi was raised on hardcourts but found much of his early major-tournament success on the red clay of Roland Garros reaching two consecutive finals there early in his career. Despite grass being his worst surface his first major win was at the slick grass of Wimbledon in 1992 a tournament that he professed to hating at the time. His strongest surface over the course of his career was indeed hardcourt where he won six of his eight majors.

630,Apollo 13,Popular culture and media,"
The 1974 movie ''Houston We've Got a Problem'' while set around the Apollo 13 incident is a fictional drama about the crises faced by ground personnel when the emergency disrupts their work schedules and places additional stress on their lives; only a couple of news clips and a narrator's solemn voice deal with the actual problems. ""Houston... We've Got a Problem"" was also the title of an episode of the BBC documentary series ''A Life At Stake'' broadcast in March 1978. This was an accurate if simplified reconstruction of the events.

Lovell was approached in 1991 by journalist Jeffrey Kluger about collaborating on a non-fiction account of the mission. The resultant book ''Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13'' was published in 1994. The next year a film adaptation of the book ''Apollo 13'' was released directed by Ron Howard and starring Tom Hanks as Lovell Bill Paxton as Haise Kevin Bacon as Swigert Gary Sinise as Mattingly Ed Harris as flight director Gene Kranz and Kathleen Quinlan as Marilyn Lovell. James Lovell Eugene Kranz and other principals have stated that this film depicted the events of the mission with reasonable accuracy given that some dramatic license was taken. For example the film changes the tense of Lovell's famous follow-up to Swigert's original words from ""Houston we've had a problem"" to ""Houston we ''have'' a problem"". The film was nominated for several Academy Awards including Best Picture Best Supporting Actor (Harris) and Best Supporting Actress (Quinlan).

In the 1998 miniseries ''From the Earth to the Moon'' co-produced by Hanks and Howard the mission is dramatized in the episode ""We Interrupt This Program"". Rather than showing the incident from the crew's perspective as in the ''Apollo 13'' feature film it is instead presented from an Earth-bound perspective of television reporters competing for coverage of the event.

In 2008 an interactive theatrical show titled ''Apollo 13: Mission Control'' premiered at BATS Theatre in Wellington New Zealand. The production faithfully recreated the mission control consoles and audience members became part of the storyline. The show also featured a 'guest' astronaut each night: a member of the public who suited up and amongst other duties stirred the oxygen tanks and said the line ""Houston we've had a problem."" This 'replacement' astronaut was a nod to Jack Swigert who replaced Ken Mattingly shortly before the launch in 1970. The production toured to other cities extensively in New Zealand and Australia in 2010–2011. The production was scheduled to travel to the US in 2012.

In the ''DC's Legends of Tomorrow'' episode 'Moonshot' the oxygen tank explosion is averted when Eobard Thawne disguises himself as Swigert in order to retrieve a piece of the Spear of Destiny that was hidden in the pole section of the American flag planted on July 21 1969. Thawne and Ray Palmer crash land the lander on the Moon's surface.

In November 2011 a notebook containing a checklist Lovell used to calculate a trajectory to get the damaged spacecraft Apollo 13 back to Earth and handwritten calculations by Lovell was auctioned off by Heritage Auctions for $388375. NASA made an email inquiry asking Heritage if Lovell had clear title to the notebook stating that NASA had ""nothing to indicate"" the agency had ever transferred ownership of the checklist to Lovell. In January 2012 Heritage stated that the sale had been placed on hold after NASA launched an investigation into whether it was the astronaut’s property to sell.

397,Ahab,Ahab's life and reign,"Omri (Ahab's father and founder of the short-lived Omri Dynasty) seems to have been a successful military leader; he is reported in the text of the Moabite Mesha Stele to have ""oppressed Moab for many days"".  During Ahab's reign Moab which had been conquered by his father remained tributary.  Ahab was allied by marriage with Jehoshaphat who was king of Judah. Only with Aram Damascus is he believed to have had strained relations.

Ahab married Jezebel the daughter of the King of Tyre. 1 Kings 16–22 tells the story of Ahab and Jezebel and indicates that Jezebel was a dominant influence on Ahab and strove to spread idol worship of Baal in Israel. Ahab was succeeded by Ahaziah and Jehoram who reigned over Israel until Jehu's revolt of 842 BC.
Shalmaneser III's (859–824 BC) Kurkh Monolith names King Ahab. (See List of artifacts significant to the Bible)

===Battle of Qarqar===
The Battle of Qarqar is mentioned in extra-biblical records and was perhaps at Apamea where Shalmaneser III of Assyria fought a great confederation of princes from Cilicia Northern Syria Israel Ammon and the tribes of the Syrian desert (853 BC) including Ahab the Israelite (''A-ha-ab-bu matSir-'a-la-a-a'') and Hadadezer (''Adad-'idri'').

Ahab's contribution was estimated at 2000 chariots and 10000 men. In reality however the number of chariots in Ahab's forces was probably closer to a number in the hundreds (based upon archaeological excavations of the area and the foundations of stables that have been found). If however the numbers are referring to allies it could possibly include forces from Tyre Judah Edom and Moab. The Assyrian king claimed a victory but his immediate return and subsequent expeditions in 849 BC and 846 BC against a similar but unspecified coalition seem to show that he met with no lasting success. According to the Tanakh however Ahab with 7000 troops had previously overthrown Ben-hadad and his thirty-two kings who had come to lay siege to Samaria and in the following year obtained a decisive victory over him at Aphek probably in the plain of Sharon at Antipatris (1 Kings 20). A treaty was made whereby Ben-hadad restored the cities which his father had taken from Ahab's father and trading facilities between Damascus and Samaria were granted.

Jezreel has been identified as Ahab's fortified chariot and cavalry base.

===Ahab and the Prophets===
In the Biblical text Ahab has five important encounters with prophets. 
The first encounter is with Elijah whom Ahab refers to as ""the troubler of Israel"" (1 Kings 18:17) in which Elijah predicts a drought (1 Kings 17:1). This encounter ends with Elijah victorious over the official Baal prophets of Israel in a contest held for the sake of the Israelites and their king Ahab. The contest ends when Elijah's God consumes the offering which the Baal worshipers could not induce their god to touch after which Elijah slaughters the Baal prophets (1 Kings 18:17–40). The second encounter is between Ahab and an unnamed prophet in 1 Kings 20:22. The third is again between Ahab and an unnamed prophet who condemns Ahab for his actions in a battle that had just taken place (1 Kings 20:34-43). The fourth is when Elijah confronts Ahab over Ahab's and Jezebel's execution of Naboth and usurpation of the latter's ancestral vineyard (1 Kings 21:1-16). Upon the prophet's remonstration (""Hast thou killed and also taken possession?"" (1 Kings 21:19)) Ahab displayed sincere remorse (1 Kings 21:27). The fifth encounter is with Micaiah the prophet who when asked for advice on a military campaign first assures Ahab he will be successful and ultimately gives Ahab a glimpse into God's plan for Ahab to die in battle (1 Kings 22).
Death of Ahab by Gustave Doré
===Death of Ahab===
Three years later war broke out east of the Jordan River and Ahab with Jehoshaphat of Judah went to recover Ramoth-Gilead from the Arameans.  During this battle Ahab disguised himself but was mortally wounded by an unaimed arrow (1 Kings 22). The Hebrew Bible says that dogs licked his blood according to the prophecy of Elijah. But the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) adds that pigs also licked his blood symbolically making him unclean to the Israelites who abstained from pork. Ahab was succeeded by his sons Ahaziah and Jehoram.

Jezebel's death however was more dramatic than Ahab's. As recorded in 2 Kings 9:30-34 Jezebel was confronted by Jehu who had her servants throw her out the window causing her death.

591,Abu Bakr,Death of Muhammad,"
A short time after returning from the farewell pilgrimage Muhammad became ill. In his fatal illness Muhammad came out with a piece of cloth tied around his head and sat on the pulpit. After thanking and praising God he said: """" (""God has given one of His slaves the choice between this world and that which is with Him and this slave has chosen that which is with God."")

Abu Bakr wept profusely and said ""Our fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you."" The companions were astonished by this (they wondered why Abu Bakr wept) and the people said ""Look at this old man! Allah's Apostle talks about a Slave of Allah to whom He has given the option to choose either the splendor of this worldly life or the good which is with Him while he says ""our fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you"". It turned out Muhammad himself was that servant as Abu Bakr later told the companions.

Muhammad continued:

No doubt I am indebted to Abu Bakr more than to anybody else regarding both his companionship and his wealth. And if I had to take a Khalil from my followers I would certainly have taken Abu Bakr but the fraternity of Islam is sufficient. Let no Door of the Mosque remain open except the door of Abu Bakr

The good referred in the first part means the good in the hereafter. Khalil means intimate friend. The door referred to here is the door to the mosque of Muhammad. When the fever developed he directed Abu Bakr to go to the war following Usama who was 18. When Muhammad died Muslims gathered in Al-Masjid al-Nabawi and there were suppressed sobs and sighs. Abu Bakr came from his house at As-Sunh (a village) on a horse where he had been with his new wife. He dismounted and entered the Prophet's Mosque but did not speak to anyone until he entered upon 'Aa'isha. He went straight to Muhammad who was covered with Hibra cloth (a kind of Yemenite cloth). He then uncovered Muhammad's face and bowed over him and kissed him and wept saying ""Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you. By Allah Allah will never cause you to die twice. As for the death which was written for you has come upon you."" 'Umar was making a sermon to the people saying ""By Allah he is not dead but has gone to his Lord as Musa ibn Imran went and remained hidden from his people for forty days. Musa returned after it was said that he had died. By Allah the Messenger of Allah will come back and he will cut off the hands and legs of those who claim his death.""

Abu Bakr arrived and said ""Sit down O 'Umar!"" But 'Umar refused to sit down. So the people came to Abu Bakr and left Umar. Abu Bakr said
""To proceed if anyone amongst you used to worship Muhammad then Muhammad has passed away but if (anyone of) you used to worship Allah then Allah is Alive and shall never die. Allah said ""And Muhammad is but a messenger; the messengers have come before him; if then he dies or is killed will you turn back upon your heels? And whoever turns back upon his heels he will by no means do harm to Allah in the least and Allah will reward the grateful."" (3.144)

'Umar said ""By Allah when I heard Abu Bakr reciting it my legs could not support me and I fell down at the very moment of hearing him reciting it declaring that Muhammad had passed away.""

62,Atomic number,Chemical properties,"Each element has a specific set of chemical properties as a consequence of the number of electrons present in the neutral atom which is ''Z'' (the atomic number). The configuration of these electrons follows from the principles of quantum mechanics. The number of electrons in each element's electron shells particularly the outermost valence shell is the primary factor in determining its chemical bonding behavior. Hence it is the atomic number alone that determines the chemical properties of an element; and it is for this reason that an element can be defined as consisting of ''any'' mixture of atoms with a given atomic number.

283,Anaximander,Other accomplishments,"
===Cartography===
Possible rendering of Anaximander's world map

Both Strabo and Agathemerus (later Greek geographers) claim that according to the geographer Eratosthenes Anaximander was the first to publish a map of the world. The map probably inspired the Greek historian Hecataeus of Miletus to draw a more accurate version. Strabo viewed both as the first geographers after Homer.

Maps were produced in ancient times also notably in Egypt Lydia the Middle East and Babylon. Only some small examples survived until today. The unique example of a world map comes from late Babylonian tablet BM 92687 later than 9th century BC but is based probably on a much older map. These maps indicated directions roads towns borders and geological features. Anaximander's innovation was to represent the entire inhabited land known to the ancient Greeks.

Such an accomplishment is more significant than it at first appears. Anaximander most likely drew this map for three reasons. First it could be used to improve navigation and trade between Miletus's colonies and other colonies around the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. Second Thales would probably have found it easier to convince the Ionian city-states to join in a federation in order to push the Median threat away if he possessed such a tool. Finally the philosophical idea of a global representation of the world simply for the sake of knowledge was reason enough to design one.

Surely aware of the sea's convexity he may have designed his map on a slightly rounded metal surface. The centre or “navel” of the world ( ''omphalós gẽs'') could have been Delphi but is more likely in Anaximander's time to have been located near Miletus. The Aegean Sea was near the map's centre and enclosed by three continents themselves located in the middle of the ocean and isolated like islands by sea and rivers. Europe was bordered on the south by the Mediterranean Sea and was separated from Asia by the Black Sea the Lake Maeotis and further east either by the Phasis River (now called the Rioni) or the Tanais. The Nile flowed south into the ocean separating Libya (which was the name for the part of the then-known African continent) from Asia.

===Gnomon===
The ''Suda'' relates that Anaximander explained some basic notions of geometry. It also mentions his interest in the measurement of time and associates him with the introduction in Greece of the gnomon. In Lacedaemon he participated in the construction or at least in the adjustment of sundials to indicate solstices and equinoxes. Indeed a gnomon required adjustments from a place to another because of the difference in latitude.

In his time the gnomon was simply a vertical pillar or rod mounted on a horizontal plane. The position of its shadow on the plane indicated the time of day. As it moves through its apparent course the sun draws a curve with the tip of the projected shadow which is shortest at noon when pointing due south. The variation in the tip’s position at noon indicates the solar time and the seasons; the shadow is longest on the winter solstice and shortest on the summer solstice.

The invention of the gnomon itself cannot be attributed to Anaximander because its use as well as the division of days into twelve parts came from the Babylonians. It is they according to Herodotus' Histories (II 109) who gave the Greeks the art of time measurement. It is likely that he was not the first to determine the solstices because no calculation is necessary. On the other hand equinoxes do not correspond to the middle point between the positions during solstices as the Babylonians thought. As the ''Suda'' seems to suggest it is very likely that with his knowledge of geometry he became the first Greek to accurately determine the equinoxes.

===Prediction of an earthquake===
In his philosophical work De Divinatione (I 50 112) Cicero states that Anaximander convinced the inhabitants of Lacedaemon to abandon their city and spend the night in the country with their weapons because an earthquake was near. The city collapsed when the top of the Taygetus split like the stern of a ship. Pliny the Elder also mentions this anecdote (II 81) suggesting that it came from an ""admirable inspiration"" as opposed to Cicero who did not associate the prediction with divination.

290,Aleister Crowley,Early life,"
===Youth: 1875–94===
Aleister Crowley was born as Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in Royal Leamington Spa Warwickshire on 12 October 1875.

Crowley was born as Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in Royal Leamington Spa Warwickshire on 12 October 1875. His father Edward Crowley (1834–87) was trained as an engineer but his share in a lucrative family brewing business Crowley's Alton Ales had allowed him to retire before his son was born. His mother Emily Bertha Bishop (1848–1917) came from a Devonshire-Somerset family and had a strained relationship with her son; she described him as ""the Beast"" a name that he revelled in. The couple had been married at London's Kensington Registry Office in November 1874 and were evangelical Christians. Crowley's father had been born a Quaker but had converted to the Exclusive Brethren a faction of a Christian fundamentalist group known as the Plymouth Brethren with Emily joining him upon marriage. Crowley's father was particularly devout spending his time as a travelling preacher for the sect and reading a chapter from the Bible to his wife and son after breakfast every day. Following the death of their baby daughter in 1880 in 1881 the Crowleys moved to Redhill Surrey. At the age of 8 Crowley was sent to H.T. Habershon's evangelical Christian boarding school in Hastings and then to Ebor preparatory school in Cambridge run by the Reverend Henry d'Arcy Champney whom Crowley considered a sadist.

In March 1887 when Crowley was 11 his father died of tongue cancer. Crowley described this as a turning point in his life and he always maintained an admiration of his father describing him as ""his hero and his friend"". Inheriting a third of his father's wealth he began misbehaving at school and was harshly punished by Champney; Crowley's family removed him from the school when he developed albuminuria. He then attended Malvern College and Tonbridge School both of which he despised and left after a few terms. He became increasingly sceptical regarding Christianity pointing out inconsistencies in the Bible to his religious teachers and went against the Christian morality of his upbringing by smoking masturbating and having sex with prostitutes from whom he contracted gonorrhea. Sent to live with a Brethren tutor in Eastbourne he undertook chemistry courses at Eastbourne College. Crowley developed interests in chess poetry and mountain climbing and in 1894 climbed Beachy Head before visiting the Alps and joining the Scottish Mountaineering Club. The following year he returned to the Bernese Alps climbing the Eiger Trift Jungfrau Mönch and Wetterhorn.

===Cambridge University: 1895–98===

Having adopted the name of Aleister over Edward in October 1895 Crowley began a three-year course at Trinity College Cambridge where he was entered for the Moral Science Tripos studying philosophy. With approval from his personal tutor he changed to English literature which was not then part of the curriculum offered. Crowley spent much of his time at university engaged in his pastimes becoming president of the chess club and practising the game for two hours a day; he briefly considered a professional career as a chess player. Crowley also embraced his love of literature and poetry particularly the works of Richard Francis Burton and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Many of his own poems appeared in student publications such as ''The Granta'' ''Cambridge Magazine'' and ''Cantab''. He continued his mountaineering going on holiday to the Alps to climb every year from 1894 to 1898 often with his friend Oscar Eckenstein and in 1897 he made the first ascent of the Mönch without a guide. These feats led to his recognition in the Alpine mountaineering community.



Crowley had his first significant mystical experience while on holiday in Stockholm in December 1896. Several biographers including Lawrence Sutin Richard Kaczynski and Tobias Churton believed that this was the result of Crowley's first same-sex sexual experience which enabled him to recognise his bisexuality. At Cambridge Crowley maintained a vigorous sex life with women—largely with female prostitutes from one of whom he caught syphilis—but eventually he took part in same-sex activities despite their illegality. In October 1897 Crowley met Herbert Charles Pollitt president of the Cambridge University Footlights Dramatic Club and the two entered into a relationship. They broke apart because Pollitt did not share Crowley's increasing interest in Western esotericism a breakup that Crowley would regret for many years.

In 1897 Crowley travelled to St Petersburg in Russia later claiming that he was trying to learn Russian as he was considering a future diplomatic career there. Biographers Richard Spence and Tobias Churton suggested that Crowley had done so as an intelligence agent under the employ of the British secret service speculating that he had been enlisted while at Cambridge.

In October 1897 a brief illness triggered considerations of mortality and ""the futility of all human endeavour"" and Crowley abandoned all thoughts of a diplomatic career in favour of pursuing an interest in the occult. In March 1898 he obtained A.E. Waite's ''The Book of Black Magic and of Pacts'' (1898) and then Karl von Eckartshausen's ''The Cloud Upon the Sanctuary'' (1896) furthering his occult interests.
In 1898 Crowley privately published 100 copies of his poem ''Aceldama: A Place to Bury Strangers In'' but it was not a particular success. That same year he published a string of other poems including ''White Stains'' a Decadent collection of erotic poetry that was printed abroad lest its publication be prohibited by the British authorities. In July 1898 he left Cambridge not having taken any degree at all despite a ""first class"" showing in his 1897 exams and consistent ""second class honours"" results before that.

===The Golden Dawn: 1898–99===
Golden Dawn garb
In August 1898 Crowley was in Zermatt Switzerland where he met the chemist Julian L. Baker and the two began discussing their common interest in alchemy. Back in London Baker introduced Crowley to George Cecil Jones Baker's brother in-law and a fellow member of the occult society known as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn which had been founded in 1888. Crowley was initiated into the Outer Order of the Golden Dawn on 18 November 1898 by the group's leader Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers. The ceremony took place in the Golden Dawn's Isis-Urania Temple held at London's Mark Masons Hall where Crowley took the magical motto and name ""Frater Perdurabo"" which he interpreted as ""I shall endure to the end"". Biographers Richard Spence and Tobias Churton have suggested that Crowley joined the Order under the command of the British secret services to monitor the activities of Mathers who was known to be a Carlist.

Crowley moved into his own luxury flat at 67–69 Chancery Lane and soon invited a senior Golden Dawn member Allan Bennett to live with him as his personal magical tutor. Bennett taught Crowley more about ceremonial magic and the ritual use of drugs and together they performed the rituals of the ''Goetia'' until Bennett left for South Asia to study Buddhism. In November 1899 Crowley purchased Boleskine House in Foyers on the shore of Loch Ness in Scotland. He developed a love of Scottish culture describing himself as the ""Laird of Boleskine"" and took to wearing traditional highland dress even during visits to London. He continued writing poetry publishing ''Jezebel and Other Tragic Poems'' ''Tales of Archais'' ''Songs of the Spirit'' ''Appeal to the American Republic'' and ''Jephthah'' in 1898–99; most gained mixed reviews from literary critics although ''Jephthah'' was considered a particular critical success.

Crowley soon progressed through the lower grades of the Golden Dawn and was ready to enter the group's inner Second Order. He was unpopular in the group; his bisexuality and libertine lifestyle had gained him a bad reputation and he had developed feuds with some of the members including W.B. Yeats. When the Golden Dawn's London lodge refused to initiate Crowley into the Second Order he visited Mathers in Paris who personally admitted him into the Adeptus Minor Grade. A schism had developed between Mathers and the London members of the Golden Dawn who were unhappy with his autocratic rule. Acting under Mathers' orders Crowley – with the help of his mistress and fellow initiate Elaine Simpson – attempted to seize the Vault of the Adepts a temple space at 36 Blythe Road in West Kensington from the London lodge members. When the case was taken to court the judge ruled in favour of the London lodge as they had paid for the space's rent leaving both Crowley and Mathers isolated from the group. Spence suggested that the entire scenario was part of an intelligence operation to undermine Mathers' authority.

===Mexico India Paris and marriage: 1900–03===

In 1900 Crowley travelled to Mexico via the United States settling in Mexico City and taking a local woman as his mistress. Developing a love of the country he continued experimenting with ceremonial magic working with John Dee's Enochian invocations. He later claimed to have been initiated into Freemasonry while there and he wrote a play based on Richard Wagner's ''Tannhäuser'' as well as a series of poems published as ''Oracles'' (1905). Eckenstein joined him later that year and together they climbed several mountains including Iztaccihuatl Popocatepetl and Colima the latter of which they had to abandon owing to a volcanic eruption. Spence has suggested that the purpose of the trip might have been to explore Mexican oil prospects for British intelligence. Leaving Mexico Crowley headed to San Francisco before sailing for Hawaii aboard the ''Nippon Maru''. On the ship he had a brief affair with a married woman named Mary Alice Rogers; saying he had fallen in love with her he wrote a series of poems about the romance published as ''Alice: An Adultery'' (1903).

Crowley during the K2 Expedition
Briefly stopping in Japan and Hong Kong Crowley reached Ceylon where he met with Allan Bennett who was there studying Shaivism. The pair spent some time in Kandy before Bennett decided to become a Buddhist monk in the Theravada tradition travelling to Burma to do so. Crowley decided to tour India devoting himself to the Hindu practice of ''raja yoga'' from which he claimed to have achieved the spiritual state of ''dhyana''. He spent much of this time studying at the Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madura. At this time he also composed and also wrote poetry which was published as ''The Sword of Song'' (1904). He contracted malaria and had to recuperate from the disease in Calcutta and Rangoon. In 1902 he was joined in India by Eckenstein and several other mountaineers: Guy Knowles H. Pfannl V. Wesseley and Jules Jacot-Guillarmod. Together the Eckenstein-Crowley expedition attempted K2 which had never been climbed. On the journey Crowley was afflicted with influenza malaria and snow blindness and other expedition members were also struck with illness. They reached an altitude of  before turning back.

Having arrived in Paris in November 1902 he socialised with friend and future brother-in-law the painter Gerald Kelly and through him became a fixture of the Parisian arts scene. Whilst there Crowley wrote a series of poems on the work of an acquaintance the sculptor Auguste Rodin. These poems were later published as ''Rodin in Rime'' (1907). One of those frequenting this milieu was W. Somerset Maugham who after briefly meeting Crowley later used him as a model for the character of Oliver Haddo in his novel ''The Magician'' (1908). Returning to Boleskine in April 1903 in August Crowley wed Gerald's sister Rose Edith Kelly in a ""marriage of convenience"" to prevent her entering an arranged marriage; the marriage appalled the Kelly family and damaged his friendship with Gerald. Heading on a honeymoon to Paris Cairo and then Ceylon Crowley fell in love with Rose and worked to prove his affections. While on his honeymoon he wrote her a series of love poems published as ''Rosa Mundi and other Love Songs'' (1906) as well as authoring the religious satire ''Why Jesus Wept'' (1904).

889,Ælle of Sussex,Reign,"A map of south-eastern England showing places visited by Ælle according to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' and the area of modern Sussex.If the dates given by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' are accurate to within half a century then Ælle's reign lies in the middle of the Anglo-Saxon expansion and prior to the final conquest of the Britons. It also seems consistent with the dates given to assume that Ælle's battles predate Mons Badonicus.This in turn would explain the long gap of fifty or more years in the succession of the ""bretwaldas"": if the peace gained by the Britons did indeed hold till the second half of the 6th century it is not to be expected that an Anglo-Saxon leader should have anything resembling overlordship of England during that time. The idea of a pause in the Anglo-Saxon advance is also supported by the account in Procopius of 6th century migration from Britain to the kingdom of the Franks.  Procopius's account is consistent with what is known to be a contemporary colonization of Armorica (now Brittany in France); the settlers appear to have been at least partly from Dumnonia (modern Cornwall) and the area acquired regions known as Dumnonée and Cornouaille.  It seems likely that something at that time was interrupting the general flow of the Anglo-Saxons from the continent to Britain.

The dates for Ælle's battles are also reasonably consistent with what is known of events in the kingdom of the Franks at that time.  Clovis I united the Franks into a single kingdom during the 480s and afterwards and the Franks' ability to exercise power along the southern coast of the English channel may have diverted Saxon adventurers to England rather than the continent.

It is possible therefore that a historical king named Ælle existed who arrived from the continent in the late 5th century and who conquered much of what is now Sussex.  He may have been a prominent war chief with a leadership role in a federation of Anglo-Saxon groups fighting for territory in Britain at that time.  This may be the origin of the reputation that led Bede to list him as holding overlordship over southern Britain.  The battles listed in the ''Chronicle'' are compatible with a conquest of Sussex from west to east against British resistance stiff enough to last fourteen years.  His area of military control may have extended as far as Hampshire and north to the upper Thames valley but it certainly did not extend across all of England south of the Humber as Bede asserts.

The historian Guy Halsall argues that as Ælle immediately preceded the late sixth-century King Ceawlin as Bretwalda it is far more likely that Ælle dates to the mid sixth century and that the ''Chronicle'' has moved his dates back a century in order to provide a foundation myth for Sussex which puts it chronologically and geographically between the origins of the kingdoms of Kent and Wessex.

472,Amaranth,Introduction,"





'''''Amaranthus''''' collectively known as '''amaranth''' is a cosmopolitan genus of annual or short-lived perennial plants. Some amaranth species are cultivated as leaf vegetables pseudocereals and ornamental plants. Most of the ''Amaranthus'' species are summer annual weeds and are commonly referred to as pigweed. Catkin-like cymes of densely packed flowers grow in summer or autumn. Approximately 60 species are recognized with inflorescences and foliage ranging from purple through red and green to gold. Members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus ''Celosia''.

""Amaranth"" derives from Greek  (''amárantos'') ""unfading"" with the Greek word for ""flower""  (''ánthos'') factoring into the word's development as ''amaranth''. ''Amarant'' is an archaic variant.

Other Asterales are Rousseaceae (four genera) Campanulaceae (eighty four genera) and Pentaphragmataceae (one genus).

All Asterales families are represented in the Southern Hemisphere; however Asteraceae and Campanulaceae are cosmopolitan and Menyanthaceae nearly so.

315,Athens,Etymology,"
Athena patron goddess of Athens; (Varvakeion Athena National Archaeological Museum)

In Ancient Greek the name of the city was  (''Athēnai''  in Classical Attic) a plural. In earlier Greek such as Homeric Greek the name had been current in the singular form though as  (''Athēnē''). It was possibly rendered in the plural later on like those of  (''Thêbai'') and  (''Μukênai''). The root of the word is perhaps not of Greek or Indo-European origin and is a possible remnant of the Pre-Greek substrate of Attica as could be the name of the goddess Athena (Attic  ''Athēnā'' Ionic  ''Athēnē'' and Doric  ''Athānā'') that was always related to the city of Athens. During the medieval period the name of the city was rendered once again in the singular as . However after the establishment of the modern Greek state and partly due to the conservatism of the written language   became again the official name of the city and remained so until the abandonment of Katharevousa in the 1970s when Ἀθήνα ''Athína'' became the official name.

An etiological myth explaining how Athens has acquired its name was well known among ancient Athenians and even became the theme of the sculpture on the West pediment of the Parthenon. The goddess of wisdom Athena and the god of the seas Poseidon had many disagreements and battles between themselves and one of these was a race to be the Patron God of the city. In an attempt to compel the people Poseidon created a salt water spring by striking the ground with his trident symbolizing naval power. However when Athena created the olive tree symbolizing peace and prosperity the Athenians under their ruler Cecrops accepted the olive tree and named the city after Athena.

Different etymologies now commonly rejected were proposed during the 19th century. Christian Lobeck proposed as the root of the name the word  (''áthos'') or  (''ánthos'') meaning ""flower"" to denote Athens as the ""flowering city"". Ludwig von Döderlein proposed the stem of the verb  stem θη- (''tháō'' ''thē-'' ""to suck"") to denote Athens as having fertile soil.

In classical literature the city was sometimes referred to as the City of the Violet Crown first documented in Pindar's ἰοστέφανοι Ἀθᾶναι (''iostéphanoi Athânai'') or as  (''tò kleinòn ásty'' ""the glorious city""). In medieval texts variant names include Setines Satine and Astines all derivations involving false splitting of prepositional phrases. Today the caption  (''ī protévousa'') ""the capital"" has become somewhat common.

87,Alberta,Demographics,"

Alberta's population has grown steadily for over a century.

The 2016 census reported Alberta had a population of 4067175 living in 1527678 of its 1654129 total dwellings an 11.6% change from its 2011 population of 3645257. With a land area of  it had a population density of  in 2016. Statistics Canada estimated the province to have a population of 4280127 in Q1 of 2017.

Alberta has experienced a relatively high rate of growth in recent years mainly because of its burgeoning economy. Between 2003 and 2004 the province had high birthrates (on par with some larger provinces such as British Columbia) relatively high immigration and a high rate of interprovincial migration compared to other provinces.

About 81% of the population lives in urban areas and only about 19% in rural areas. The Calgary–Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized area in the province and is one of the most densely populated areas of Canada. Many of Alberta's cities and towns have experienced very high rates of growth in recent history. Alberta's population rose from 73022 in 1901 to 3290350 according to the 2006 census.
English is the most common mother tongue of Albertans.

The 2006 census found that English with 2576670 native speakers was the most common mother tongue of Albertans representing 79.99% of the population. The next most common mother tongues were Chinese with 97275 native speakers (3.02%) followed by German with 84505 native speakers (2.62%) and French with 61225 (1.90%).

Other mother tongues include: Punjabi with 36320 native speakers (1.13%); Tagalog with 29740 (0.92%); Ukrainian with 29455 (0.91%); Spanish with 29125 (0.90%); Polish with 21990 (0.68%); Arabic with 20495 (0.64%); Dutch with 19980 (0.62%); and Vietnamese with 19350 (0.60%). The most common aboriginal language is Cree 17215 (0.53%). Other common mother tongues include Italian with 13095 speakers (0.41%); Urdu with 11275 (0.35%); and Korean with 10845 (0.33%); then Hindi 8985 (0.28%); Persian 7700 (0.24%); Portuguese 7205 (0.22%); and Hungarian 6770 (0.21%).''(Figures shown are for the number of single language responses and the percentage of total single-language responses.)''

Alberta has considerable ethnic diversity. In line with the rest of Canada many immigrants originated from England Scotland Ireland Wales and France but large numbers also came from other parts of Europe notably Germany Ukraine and Scandinavia. According to Statistics Canada Alberta is home to the second highest proportion (two percent) of Francophones in western Canada (after Manitoba). Despite this relatively few Albertans claim French as their mother tongue. Many of Alberta's French-speaking residents live in the central and northwestern regions of the province.

As reported in the 2001 census the Chinese represented nearly four percent of Alberta's population and East Indians represented more than two percent. Both Edmonton and Calgary have historic Chinatowns and Calgary has Canada's third largest Chinese community. The Chinese presence began with workers employed in the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s. Aboriginal Albertans make up approximately three percent of the population.

In the 2006 Canadian census the most commonly reported ethnic origins among Albertans were: 885825 English (27.2%); 679705 German (20.9%); 667405 Canadian (20.5%); 661265 Scottish (20.3%); 539160 Irish (16.6%); 388210 French (11.9%); 332180 Ukrainian (10.2%); 172910 Dutch (5.3%); 170935 Polish (5.2%); 169355 North American Indian (5.2%); 144585 Norwegian (4.4%); and 137600 Chinese (4.2%). (Each person could choose as many ethnicities as were applicable.)''

Amongst those of British origins the Scots have had a particularly strong influence on place-names with the names of many cities and towns including Calgary Airdrie Canmore and Banff having Scottish origins.

Alberta is the third most diverse province in terms of visible minorities after British Columbia and Ontario with 13.9% of the population consisting of visible minorities. Nearly one-fourth of the populations of Calgary and Edmonton belong to a visible minority group.

Aboriginal Identity Peoples make up 5.8% of the population about half of whom consist of North American Indians and the other half are Metis. There are also small number of Inuit people in Alberta. The number of Aboriginal Identity Peoples have been increasing at a rate greater than the population of Alberta.

As of 2011 Christians comprised approximately 60% of Alberta's population while 32% of the province had no religious affiliation.

As of the 2011 National Household Survey the largest religious group was Roman Catholic representing 24.3% of the population. Alberta had the second highest percentage of non-religious residents among the provinces (after British Columbia) at 31.6% of the population. Of the remainder 7.5% of the population identified themselves as belonging to the United Church of Canada while 3.9% were Anglican. Lutherans made up 3.3% of the population while Baptists comprised 1.9%.


The remainder belonged to a wide variety of different religious affiliations none of which constituted more than 2% of the population. Members of LDS Church are mostly concentrated in the extreme south of the province. Alberta has a population of Hutterites a communal Anabaptist sect similar to the Mennonites and has a significant population of Seventh-day Adventists. Alberta is home to several Byzantine Rite Churches as part of the legacy of Eastern European immigration including the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Edmonton and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada's Western Diocese which is based in Edmonton.

Muslims Sikhs Buddhists and Hindus live in Alberta. Muslims made up 3.2% of the population Sikhs 1.5% Buddhists 1.2% and Hindus 1.0%. Many of these are recent immigrants but others have roots that go back to the first settlers of the prairies. Canada's oldest mosque the Al-Rashid Mosque is located in Edmonton whereas Calgary is home to Canada's largest mosque the Baitun Nur mosque. Alberta is also home to a growing Jewish population of about 15400 people who constituted 0.3% of Alberta's population. Most of Alberta's Jews live in the metropolitan areas of Calgary (8200) and Edmonton (5500).

400,Algol,Names,"''Beta Persei'' is the star's Bayer designation. The name ''Algol'' derives from Arabic  ''raʾs al-ghūl'' : head (''raʾs'') of the ogre (''al-ghūl'') (see ""ghoul""). The English name ""''Demon Star''"" is a direct translation of this. In 2016 the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included ''Algol'' for this star. It is so entered on the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

In Hebrew folklore Algol was called ''Rōsh ha Sāṭān'' or ""Satan's Head"" as stated by Edmund Chilmead who called it ""Divels head"" or ''Rosch hassatan''. A Latin name for Algol from the 16th century was ''Caput Larvae'' or ""the Spectre's Head"". Hipparchus and Pliny made this a separate though connected constellation.

In Chinese  () meaning ''Mausoleum'' refers to an asterism consisting of β Persei 9 Persei τ Persei ι Persei κ Persei ρ Persei 16 Persei and 12 Persei. Consequently β Persei itself is known as  ( English: The Fifth Star of Mausoleum.). According to R.H. Allen the star bore the grim name of ''Tseih She''  () meaning ""Piled up Corpses"" but this appears to be a misidentification and ''Dié Shī'' is correctly π Persei which is inside the Mausoleum.

In Italy he returned to painting at first producing a series of works executed in tempera on linen. These include portraits and altarpieces notably the Paumgartner altarpiece and the ''Adoration of the Magi''. In early 1506 he returned to Venice and stayed there until the spring of 1507. By this time Dürer's engravings had attained great popularity and were being copied. In Venice he was given a valuable commission from the emigrant German community for the church of San Bartolomeo. This was the altar-piece known as the ''Adoration of the Virgin'' or the ''Feast of Rose Garlands''. It includes portraits of members of Venice's German community but shows a strong Italian influence. It was subsequently acquired by the Emperor Rudolf II and taken to Prague. Other paintings Dürer produced in Venice include ''The Virgin and Child with the Goldfinch'' ''Christ among the Doctors'' (supposedly produced in a mere five days) and a number of smaller works.

25,ASCII,{{anchor|Variants}}Variants and derivations,"As computer technology spread throughout the world different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ASCII to facilitate the expression of non-English languages that used Roman-based alphabets. One could class some of these variations as ""ASCII extensions"" although some misuse that term to represent all variants including those that do not preserve ASCII's character-map in the 7-bit range. Furthermore the ASCII extensions have also been mislabelled as ASCII.

===7-bit codes===

From early in its development ASCII was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard.


Other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as ISO 646 (1967) that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII with extensions for characters outside the English alphabet and symbols used outside the United States such as the symbol for the United Kingdom's pound sterling (£). Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII since ASCII suited the needs of only the US and a few other countries. For example Canada had its own version that supported French characters.

Many other countries developed variants of ASCII to include non-English letters (e.g. é ñ ß Ł) currency symbols (e.g. £ ¥) etc. See also YUSCII (Yugoslavia).

It would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several code points reserved for ""national use"". However the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISO's first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 caused ASCII's choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points.

ISO/IEC 646 like ASCII is a 7-bit character set. It does not make any additional codes available so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries. Escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text but they were rarely used so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character a code represented and in general text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway.

Because the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to ""national use"" code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646 a German French or Swedish etc. programmer using their national variant of ISO/IEC 646 rather than ASCII had to write and thus read something such as

:ä aÄiÜ = 'Ön'; ü

instead of

:{ ai = '\n'; }

C trigraphs were created to solve this problem for ANSI C although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use. Many programmers kept their computers on US-ASCII so plain-text in Swedish German etc. (for example in e-mail or Usenet) contained ""{ }"" and similar variants in the middle of words something those programmers got used to. For example a Swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch could get ""N{ jag har sm|rg}sar"" as the answer which should be ""Nä jag har smörgåsar"" meaning ""No I've got sandwiches"".

===8-bit codes===


Eventually as 8- 16- and 32-bit (and later 64-bit) computers began to replace 18- and 36-bit computers as the norm it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory providing an opportunity for extended 8-bit relatives of ASCII. In most cases these developed as true extensions of ASCII leaving the original character-mapping intact but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 (i.e. 7-bit) characters.

Encodings include ISCII (India) VISCII (Vietnam). Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII true ASCII is defined strictly only by the ANSI standard.

Most early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0 to 31 with more graphics. Kaypro CP/M computers used the ""upper"" 128 characters for the Greek alphabet.

The PETSCII code Commodore International used for their 8-bit systems is probably unique among post-1970 codes in being based on ASCII-1963 instead of the more common ASCII-1967 such as found on the ZX Spectrum computer. Atari 8-bit computers and Galaksija computers also used ASCII variants.

The IBM PC defined code page 437 which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions. Operating systems such as DOS supported these code pages and manufacturers of IBM PCs supported them in hardware. Digital Equipment Corporation developed the Multinational Character Set (DEC-MCS) for use in the popular VT220 terminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics. The Macintosh defined Mac OS Roman and Postscript also defined a set both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics more like modern character sets.

The ISO/IEC 8859 standard (derived from the DEC-MCS) finally provided a standard that most systems copied (at least as accurately as they copied ASCII but with many substitutions). A popular further extension designed by Microsoft Windows-1252 (often mislabeled as ISO-8859-1) added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing.  ISO-8859-1 Windows-1252 and the original 7-bit ASCII were the most common character encodings until 2008 when UTF-8 became more common.

ISO/IEC 4873 introduced 32 additional control codes defined in the 80–9F hexadecimal range as part of extending the 7-bit ASCII encoding to become an 8-bit system.

===Unicode===

Unicode and the ISO/IEC 10646 Universal Character Set (UCS) have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments. While ASCII is limited to 128 characters Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification (using natural numbers called ''code points'') and encoding (to 8- 16- or 32-bit binary formats called UTF-8 UTF-16 and UTF-32).

ASCII was incorporated into the Unicode (1991) character set as the first 128 symbols so the 7-bit ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets. This allows UTF-8 to be backward compatible with 7-bit ASCII as a UTF-8 file containing only ASCII characters is identical to an ASCII file containing the same sequence of characters.  Even more importantly forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only 7-bit ASCII characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set (as is often done to support 8-bit ASCII extensions such as ISO-8859-1) will preserve UTF-8 data unchanged.

To allow backward compatibility the 128 ASCII and 256 ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) characters are assigned Unicode/UCS code points that are the same as their codes in the earlier standards. Therefore ASCII can be considered a 7-bit encoding scheme for a very small subset of Unicode/UCS and ASCII (when prefixed with 0 as the eighth bit) is valid UTF-8.

42,Algae,Distribution,"The distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of phytogeography in the mid-19th century. Algae spread mainly by the dispersal of spores analogously to the dispersal of Plantae by seeds and spores. This dispersal can be accomplished by air water or other organisms. Due to this spores can be found in a variety of environments: fresh and marine waters air soil and in or on other organisms. Whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions where the spore lands.

The spores of freshwater algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind as well as by living carriers. However not all bodies of water can carry all species of algae as the chemical composition of certain water bodies limits the algae that can survive within them. Marine spores are often spread by ocean currents. Ocean water presents many vastly different habitats based on temperature and nutrient availability resulting in phytogeographic zones regions and provinces.

To some degree the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features such as Antarctica long distances of ocean or general land masses. It is therefore possible to identify species occurring by locality such as ""Pacific algae"" or ""North Sea algae"". When they occur out of their localities hypothesizing a transport mechanism is usually possible such as the hulls of ships. For example ''Ulva reticulata'' and ''U. fasciata'' travelled from the mainland to Hawaii in this manner.

Mapping is possible for select species only: ""there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns."" For example ''Clathromorphum'' is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there. However scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the ""difficulties of undertaking such studies.""

44,Alkane,Structure classification,"
Saturated hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons having only single covalent bonds between their carbons. They can be:
* linear (general formula ) wherein the carbon atoms are joined in a snake-like structure
* branched (general formula  ''n'' > 2) wherein the carbon backbone splits off in one or more directions
* cyclic (general formula  ''n'' > 3) wherein the carbon backbone is linked so as to form a loop.

According to the definition by IUPAC the former two are alkanes whereas the third group is called cycloalkanes. Saturated hydrocarbons can also combine any of the linear cyclic (e.g. polycyclic) and branching structures; the general formula is   where ''k'' is the number of independent loops. Alkanes are the acyclic (loopless) ones corresponding to ''k'' = 0.

821,Axiom of regularity,Introduction,"In mathematics the '''axiom of regularity''' (also known as the '''axiom of foundation''') is an axiom of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory that states that every non-empty set ''A'' contains an element that is disjoint from ''A''. In first-order logic the axiom reads:
: .
The axiom implies that no set is an element of itself and that there is no infinite sequence (''an'') such that ''ai+1'' is an element of ''ai'' for all ''i''. With the axiom of dependent choice (which is a weakened form of the axiom of choice) this result can be reversed: if there are no such infinite sequences then the axiom of regularity is true. Hence the axiom of regularity is equivalent given the axiom of dependent choice to the alternative axiom that there are no downward infinite membership chains.

The axiom of regularity was introduced by ; it was adopted in a formulation closer to the one found in contemporary textbooks by . Virtually all results in the branches of mathematics based on set theory hold even in the absence of regularity; see chapter 3 of .  However regularity makes some properties of ordinals easier to prove; and it not only allows induction to be done on well-ordered sets but also on proper classes that are well-founded relational structures such as the lexicographical ordering on 

Given the other axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory the axiom of regularity is equivalent to the axiom of induction. The axiom of induction tends to be used in place of the axiom of regularity in intuitionistic theories (ones that do not accept the law of the excluded middle) where the two axioms are not equivalent.

In addition to omitting the axiom of regularity non-standard set theories have indeed postulated the existence of sets that are elements of themselves.

889,Ælle of Sussex,Introduction,"

'''Ælle''' (; also '''Aelle''' or '''Ella''') is recorded in early sources as the first king of the South Saxons reigning in what is now called Sussex England from 477 to perhaps as late as 514.

According to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' Ælle and three of his sons are said to have landed at a place called Cymensora and fought against the local Britons. The chronicle goes on to report a victory in 491 at present day Pevensey where the battle ended with the Saxons slaughtering their opponents to the last man.

Ælle was the first king recorded by the 8th century chronicler Bede to have held ""imperium"" or overlordship over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. In the late 9th-century ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' (around four hundred years after his time) Ælle is recorded as being the first bretwalda or ""Britain-ruler"" though there is no evidence that this was a contemporary title.  Ælle's death is not recorded and although he may have been the founder of a South Saxon dynasty there is no firm evidence linking him with later South Saxon rulers. The 12th-century chronicler Henry of Huntingdon produced an enhanced version of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' that included 514 as the date of Ælle's death but this is not secure.

751,Alpha Centauri,Observational history,"View of Alpha Centauri from the Digitized Sky Survey 2

English explorer Robert Hues brought Alpha Centauri to the attention of European observers in his 1592 work ''Tractatus de Globis'' along with Canopus and Achernar noting ""Now therefore there are but three Stars of the first magnitude that I could perceive in all those parts which are never seene here in England. The first of these is that bright Star in the sterne of Argo which they call Canobus. The second is in the end of Eridanus. The third Alpha Centauri is in the right foote of the Centaure.""

The binary nature of Alpha Centauri AB was first recognized in December 1689 by astronomer and Jesuit priest Jean Richaud. The finding was made incidentally while observing a passing comet from his station in Puducherry. Alpha Centauri was only the second binary star system to be discovered preceded by Alpha Crucis.

By 1752 French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille made astrometric positional measurements using state-of-the-art instruments of that time. Its large proper motion was discovered by Manuel John Johnson observing from Saint Helena who informed Thomas Henderson at the Royal Observatory Cape of Good Hope of it. The parallax of Alpha Centauri was subsequently determined by Henderson from many exacting positional observations of the AB system between April 1832 and May 1833. He withheld his results however because he suspected they were too large to be true but eventually published them in 1839 after Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel released his own accurately determined parallax for 61 Cygni in 1838. For this reason Alpha Centauri is sometimes considered as the second star to have its distance measured because Henderson's work was not fully recognized at first. (The distance of Alpha is now reckoned at .)

Later John Herschel made the first micrometrical observations in 1834. Since the early 20th century measures have been made with photographic plates.

Compared to the Sun Alpha Centauri A is of the same stellar type G2 while Alpha Centauri B is a K1-type star.

By 1926 South African astronomer William Stephen Finsen calculated the approximate orbit elements close to those now accepted for this system. All future positions are now sufficiently accurate for visual observers to determine the relative places of the stars from a binary star ephemeris. Others like the Belgian astronomer D. Pourbaix (2002) have regularly refined the precision of any new published orbital elements.

Alpha Centauri is inside the G-cloud and the nearest known system to it is the binary brown dwarf system Luhman 16 at .

Scottish astronomer Robert T. A. Innes discovered Proxima Centauri in 1915 by blinking photographic plates taken at different times during a dedicated proper motion survey. This showed the large proper motion and parallax of the star was similar in both size and direction to those of Alpha Centauri AB suggesting immediately it was part of the system and slightly closer to Earth than Alpha Centauri AB. Lying  away Proxima Centauri is the nearest star to the Sun. All current derived distances for the three stars are from the parallaxes obtained from the Hipparcos star catalogue (HIP) and the Hubble Space Telescope.

271,Ardipithecus,Alternative views and further studies,"
Due to several shared characters with chimpanzees its closeness to ape divergence period and due to its fossil incompleteness the exact position of ''Ardipithecus'' in the fossil record is a subject of controversy. Independent researcher such as Esteban E. Sarmiento of the Human Evolution Foundation in New Jersey had systematically compared in 2010 the identifying characters of apes and human ancestral fossils in relation to ''Ardipithecus'' and concluded that the comparison data is not sufficient to support an exclusive human lineage. Sarmiento noted that ''Ardipithecus'' does not share any characters exclusive to humans and some of its characters (those in the wrist and basicranium) suggest it diverged from the common human/African ape stock prior to the human chimpanzee and gorilla divergence  His comparative (narrow allometry) study in 2011 on the molar and body segment lengths (which included living primates of similar body size) noted that some dimensions including short upper limbs and metacarpals are reminiscent of humans but other dimensions such as long toes and relative molar surface area are great ape-like. Sarmiento concluded that such length measures can change back and forth during evolution and are not very good indicators of relatedness. The ''Ardipithecus'' length measures however are good indicators of function and together with dental isotope data and the fauna and flora from the fossil site indicate ''Ardipithecus'' was mainly a terrestrial quadruped collecting a large portion of its food on the ground. Its arboreal behaviors would have been limited and suspension from branches solely from the upper limbs rare.

However some later studies still argue for its classification in the human lineage. Comparative study in 2013 on carbon and oxygen stable isotopes within modern and fossil tooth enamel revealed that ''Ardipithecus'' fed both arboreally (on trees) and on the ground in a more open habitat unlike chimpanzees and extinct ape ''Sivapithecus'' thereby differentiating them from other apes. In 2014 it was reported that the hand bones of ''Ardipithecus'' ''Australopithecus sediba'' and ''A. afarensis'' consist of distinct human-lineage feature (which is the presence of third metacarpal styloid process that is absent in other ape lineages). Unique brain organisations (such as lateral shift of the carotid foramina mediolateral abbreviation of the lateral tympanic and a shortened trapezoidal basioccipital element) in ''Ardipithecus'' are also found only ''Australopithecus'' and ''Homo'' clade. Comparison of the tooth root morphology with those of ''Sahelanthropus tchadensis'' also indicated strong resemblance implying its correct inclusion in human lineage.

In a study that assumes the hominin status of ''Ardipithecus ramidus'' it has been argued the species represents a heterochronic alteration of the more general great ape body plan. In this study the resemblance of the species' craniofacial moprhology with that of subadult chimpanzees is attributed to dissociation of craniofacial growth from brain growth and associated life history trajectories such as eruption of the first molar and age of first birth. Consequently it is argued the species represents a unique ontogeny unlike any extant ape. The reduced growth in the sub-nasal alveolar region of the face which houses the projecting canine complex in chimpanzees suggests the species had rates of growth and reproductive biology unlike any living primate species. In this sense the species may show the first trend towards human social parenting and sexual psychology. Consequently the authors argue it is no longer tenable to extrapolate from chimpanzees in reconstructions of early hominin social and mating behaviour providing further evidence against the so-called 'chimpanzee referential model'.  As the authors write when discussing the species unusual pattern of cranio-dental growth and the light it may throw on the origins of human sociality:

'The contrast of humans with chimpanzees is instructive for when humans start developing broader social bonds after the permanent dentition begins erupting at the same developmental milestone chimpanzee facial projection increases. In other words humans seem to have replaced craniofacial growth with an extended and intensified period of socio-emotional development. As ''A. ramidus'' no longer has an ontogeny that results in the development of a prognathic jaw with a C/P3 complex (which is one of the most important means by which males vie for status within the mating hierarchies of other primate species) young and sub-adult members of the species must have pursued other avenues by which to become reproductively successful members of the social group. The implication of these interspecific differences is that ''A. ramidus'' would have most likely had a period of infant and juvenile socialisation different from that of chimpanzees. Consequently it is possible that in ''A.ramidus'' we see the first albeit incipient trend toward human forms of child socialisation and social organisation'.

It should be noted that this view has yet to be corroborated by more detailed studies of the ontogeny of ''A.ramidus''. The study also provides support for Stephen Jay Gould's theory in ''Ontogeny and Phylogeny'' that the paedomorphic form of early hominin craniofacial morphology results from heterochronic dissociation of growth trajectories.

===Pre-Islamic===

Pre-Islamic Arabia refers to the Arabian Peninsula prior to the rise of Islam in the 630s. The study of Pre-Islamic Arabia is important to Islamic studies as it provides the context for the development of Islam. Some of the settled communities in the Arabian Peninsula developed into distinctive civilizations. Sources for these civilizations are not extensive and are limited to archaeological evidence accounts written outside of Arabia and Arab oral traditions later recorded by Islamic scholars. Among the most prominent civilizations was Dilmun which arose around the 4th millennium BC and lasted to 538 BC and Thamud which arose around the 1st millennium BC and lasted to about 300 CE. Additionally from the beginning of the first millennium BC Southern Arabia was the home to a number of kingdoms such as the Sabaean kingdom and the coastal areas of Eastern Arabia were controlled by the Parthian and Sassanians from 300 BC.

====Origins and early history====
The first written attestation of the ethnonym ''Arab'' occurs in an Assyrian inscription of 853 BCE where Shalmaneser III lists a King Gindibu of ''mâtu arbâi'' (Arab land) as among the people he defeated at the Battle of Karkar. Some of the names given in these texts are Aramaic while others are the first attestations of Ancient North Arabian dialects. In fact several different ethnonyms are found in Assyrian texts that are conventionally translated ""Arab"": ''Arabi Arubu Aribi'' and ''Urbi''. Many of the Qedarite queens were also described as queens of the ''aribi''. The Hebrew Bible occasionally refers to ''Aravi'' peoples (or variants thereof) translated as ""Arab"" or ""Arabian."" The scope of the term at that early stage is unclear but it seems to have referred to various desert-dwelling Semitic tribes in the Syrian Desert and Arabia. Arab tribes came into conflict with the Assyrians during the reign of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal and he records military victories against the powerful Qedar tribe among others.

Old Arabic diverges from Central Semitic by the beginning of the 1st millennium BC.Nabataean trade routes in Pre-Islamic Arabia.
Medieval Arab genealogists divided Arabs into three groups:
# ""Ancient Arabs"" tribes that had vanished or been destroyed such as ʿĀd and Thamud often mentioned in the Qur'an as examples of God's power to vanquish those who fought his prophets.
# ""Pure Arabs"" of South Arabia descending from Qahtan. The Qahtanites (Qahtanis) are said to have migrated from the land of Yemen following the destruction of the Ma'rib Dam (''sadd Ma'rib'').
# The ""Arabized Arabs"" (''mustaʿribah'') of Central Arabia (Najd) and North Arabia descending from Ishmael the elder son of Abraham through Adnan (hence Adnanites). The Book of Genesis narrates that God promised Hagar to beget from Ishmael twelve princes and turn him to a great nation.() The Book of Jubilees claims that the sons of Ishmael intermingled with the 6 sons of Keturah from Abraham and their descendants were called Arabs and Ishmaelites:


Assyrian horsemen pursue defeated Arabs.
Assyrian and Babylonian Royal Inscriptions and North Arabian inscriptions from 9th to 6th century B.C.E mention the king of Qedar as king of the Arabs and King of the Ishmaelites.
Of the names of the sons of Ishmael the names ""Nabat Kedar Abdeel Dumah Massa and Teman"" were mentioned in the Assyrian Royal Inscriptions as tribes of the Ishmaelites. Jesur was mentioned in Greek inscriptions in the First Century B.C.E
Life-size bronze bust sculpture of Ibn Khaldun.
Ibn Khaldun's ''Muqaddima'' distinguishes between sedentary Arabian Muslims who used to be nomadic and Bedouin nomadic Arabs of the desert. He used the term ""formerly nomadic"" Arabs and refers to sedentary Muslims by the region or city they lived in as in Yemenis. The Christians of Italy and the Crusaders preferred the term Saracens for all the Arabs and Muslims of that time. The Christians of Iberia used the term Moor to describe all the Arabs and Muslims of that time.

Muslims of Medina referred to the nomadic tribes of the deserts as the A'raab and considered themselves sedentary but were aware of their close racial bonds. The term ""A'raab"" mirrors the term Assyrians used to describe the closely related nomads they defeated in Syria. The Qur'an does not use the word '''' only the nisba adjective ''''. The Qur'an calls itself '''' ""Arabic"" and '''' ""clear"". The two qualities are connected for example in ayat 43.2–3 ""By the ''clear'' Book: We have made it an ''Arabic'' recitation in order that you may understand"". The Qur'an became regarded as the prime example of the '''' the language of the Arabs. The term ''ʾiʿrāb'' has the same root and refers to a particularly clear and correct mode of speech. The plural noun '''' refers to the Bedouin tribes of the desert who resisted Muhammad for example in ''at-Tawba'' 97

'''' ""the Bedouin are the worst in disbelief and hypocrisy"".

Based on this in early Islamic terminology '''' referred to the language and '''' to the Arab Bedouins carrying a negative connotation due to the Qur'anic verdict just cited. But after the Islamic conquest of the eighth century the language of the nomadic Arabs became regarded as the most pure by the grammarians following Abi Ishaq and the term  ""language of the Arabs"" denoted the uncontaminated language of the Bedouins.

====Classical kingdoms====

 Façade of Al Khazneh in Petra Jordan built by the Nabateans.
Proto-Arabic or Ancient North Arabian texts give a clearer picture of the Arabs' emergence. The earliest are written in variants of epigraphic south Arabian ''musnad'' script including the 8th century BCE Hasaean inscriptions of eastern Saudi Arabia the 6th century BCE Lihyanite texts of southeastern Saudi Arabia and the Thamudic texts found throughout the Arabian Peninsula and Sinai (not in reality connected with Thamud).

The Nabataeans were nomadic newcomers who moved into territory vacated by the Edomites – Semites who settled the region centuries before them. Their early inscriptions were in Aramaic but gradually switched to Arabic and since they had writing it was they who made the first inscriptions in Arabic. The Nabataean alphabet was adopted by Arabs to the south and evolved into modern Arabic script around the 4th century. This is attested by Safaitic inscriptions (beginning in the 1st century BCE) and the many Arabic personal names in Nabataean inscriptions. From about the 2nd century BCE a few inscriptions from Qaryat al-Faw reveal a dialect no longer considered ''proto-Arabic'' but ''pre-classical Arabic''. Five Syriac inscriptions mentioning Arabs have been found at Sumatar Harabesi one of which dates to the 2nd century CE.

====Late kingdoms====

The Ghassanids Lakhmids and Kindites were the last major migration of pre-Islamic Arabs out of Yemen to the north. The Ghassanids increased the Semitic presence in the then Hellenized Syria the majority of Semites were Aramaic peoples. They mainly settled in the Hauran region and spread to modern Lebanon Palestine and East Jordan. 
Costumes of Arab women 4th to 6th centuries.
Greeks and Romans referred to all the nomadic population of the desert in the Near East as Arabi. The Romans called Yemen ""Arabia Felix"". The Romans called the vassal nomadic states within the Roman Empire ''Arabia Petraea'' after the city of Petra and called unconquered deserts bordering the empire to the south and east Arabia Magna.
The Lakhmids as a dynasty inherited their power from the Tanukhids the mid Tigris region around their capital Al-Hira. They ended up allying with the Sassanids against the Ghassanids and the Byzantine Empire. The Lakhmids contested control of the Central Arabian tribes with the Kindites with the Lakhmids eventually destroying Kinda in 540 after the fall of their main ally Himyar. The Persian Sassanids dissolved the Lakhmid dynasty in 602 being under puppet kings then under their direct control.
The Kindites migrated from Yemen along with the Ghassanids and Lakhmids but were turned back in Bahrain by the Abdul Qais Rabi'a tribe. They returned to Yemen and allied themselves with the Himyarites who installed them as a vassal kingdom that ruled Central Arabia from ""Qaryah Dhat Kahl"" (the present-day called Qaryat al-Faw). They ruled much of the Northern/Central Arabian peninsula until they were destroyed by the Lakhmid king Al-Mundhir and his son 'Amr.

Age of the Caliphs   

====Arab Caliphates====

=====Rashidun Era (632–661)=====

After the death of Muhammad in 632 Rashidun armies launched campaigns of conquest establishing the Caliphate or Islamic Empire one of the largest empires in history. It was larger and lasted longer than the previous Arab empire of Queen Mawia or the Aramean-Arab Palmyrene Empire. The Rashidun state was a completely new state and unlike the Arab kingdoms of its century such as the Himyarite Lakhmids or Ghassanids.

=====Umayyad Era (661–750 & 756–1031)=====

The Great Mosque of Kairouan in Kairouan Tunisia was founded in 670 by the Arab general Uqba ibn Nafi; it is the oldest mosque in the Maghreb and represents an architectural testimony of the Arab conquest of North Africa.
In 661 the Rashidun Caliphate fell into the hands of the Umayyad dynasty and Damascus was established as the empire's capital. The Umayyads were proud of their Arab identity and sponsored the poetry and culture of pre-Islamic Arabia. They established garrison towns at Ramla Raqqa Basra Kufa Mosul and Samarra all of which developed into major cities.

Caliph Abd al-Malik established Arabic as the Caliphate's official language in 686. This reform greatly influenced the conquered non-Arab peoples and fueled the Arabization of the region. However the Arabs' higher status among non-Arab Muslim converts and the latter's obligation to pay heavy taxes caused resentment. Caliph Umar II strove to resolve the conflict when he came to power in 717. He rectified the disparity demanding that all Muslims be treated as equals but his intended reforms did not take effect as he died after only three years of rule. By now discontent with the Umayyads swept the region and an uprising occurred in which the Abbasids came to power and moved the capital to Baghdad.
The Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem constructed during the reign of Abd al Malik.
Umayyads expanded their Empire westwards capturing North Africa from the Byzantines. Before the Arab conquest North Africa was conquered or settled by various people including Punics Vandals and Romans. After the Abbasid Revolution the Ummayads lost most of their territories with the exception of Iberia. Their last holding became known as the Emirate of Córdoba. It wasn't until the rule of the grandson of the founder of this new emirate that the state entered a new phase as the Caliphate of Córdoba.  This new state was characterized by an expansion of trade culture and knowledge and saw the construction of masterpieces of al-Andalus architecture and the library of Al-Ḥakam II which housed over 400 000 volumes. With the collapse of the Umayyad state in 1031 AD Islamic Spain was divided into small kingdoms.

===== Abbassid Era (750–1258 & 1261–1517) =====

Mustansiriya University in Baghdad.
The Abbasids were the descendants of Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib one of the youngest uncles of Muhammad and of the same Banu Hashim clan. The Abbasids led a revolt against the Umayyads and defeated them in the Battle of the Zab effectively ending their rule in all parts of the Empire with the exception of al-Andalus. In 762 the second Abbasid Caliph al-Mansur founded the city of Baghdad and declared it the capital of the Caliphate. Unlike the Umayyads the Abbasids had the support of non-Arab subjects. Scholars at an Abbasid library in Baghdad. Maqamat of al-Hariri Illustration 1237.
The Islamic Golden Age was inaugurated by the middle of the 8th century by the ascension of the Abbasid Caliphate and the transfer of the capital from Damascus to the newly founded city of Baghdad. The Abbassids were influenced by the Qur'anic injunctions and hadith such as ""The ink of the scholar is more holy than the blood of martyrs"" stressing the value of knowledge. During this period the Muslim world became an intellectual centre for science philosophy medicine and education as the Abbasids championed the cause of knowledge and established the ""House of Wisdom"" () in Baghdad. Rival dynasties such as the Fatimids of Egypt and the Umayyads of al-Andalus were also major intellectual centres with cities such as Cairo and Córdoba rivaling Baghdad.

The Abbasids ruled for 200 years before they lost their central control when Wilayas began to fracture in the 10th century; afterwards in the 1190s there was a revival of their power which was ended by the Mongols who conquered Baghdad in 1258 and killed the Caliph Al-Musta'sim. Members of the Abbasid royal family escaped the massacre and resorted to Cairo which had broken from the Abbasid rule two years earlier; the Mamluk generals taking the political side of the kingdom while Abbasid Caliphs were engaged in civil activities and continued patronizing science arts and literature.

=====Fatimid Caliphate (909–1171)=====

Fragment of a bowl depicting a mounted warrior 11th century. Fatimid dynasty found in Fustat Egypt.
The Fatimid caliphate was founded by al-Mahdi Billah in the early 10th century. Egypt was the political cultural and religious centre of the Fatimid empire. The Fatimid state took shape among the Kutama Berbers in the West of the North African littoral in Algeria in 909 conquering Raqqada the Aghlabid capital. In 921 the Fatimids established the Tunisian city of Mahdia as their new capital. In 948 they shifted their capital to Al-Mansuriya near Kairouan in Tunisia and in 969 they conquered Egypt and established Cairo as the capital of their caliphate.

Intellectual life in Egypt during the Fatimid period achieved great progress and activity due to many scholars who lived in or came to Egypt as well as the number of books available. Fatimid Caliphs gave prominent positions to scholars in their courts encouraged students and established libraries in their palaces so that scholars might expand their knowledge and reap benefits from the work of their predecessors. The Fatimids were also known for their exquisite arts. Many traces of Fatimid architecture exist in Cairo today; the most defining examples include the Al-Hakim Mosque and the Al-Azhar University.

It was not until the 11th century that the Maghreb saw a large influx of ethnic Arabs. Starting with the 11th century the Arab bedouin Banu Hilal tribes migrated to the West. Having been sent by the Fatimids to punish the Berber Zirids for abandoning Shias they travelled westwards. The Banu Hilal quickly defeated the Zirids and deeply weakened the neighboring Hammadids. Their influx was a major factor in the Arabization of the Maghreb. Although Berbers ruled the region until the 16th century (under such powerful dynasties as the Almoravids the Almohads Hafsids etc.) the arrival of these tribes eventually helped Arabize much of it ethnically in addition to the linguistic and political impact on local non-Arabs.

====Ottoman Empire====

From 1517 to 1918 much of the Arab world was under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans defeated the Mamluk Sultanate in Cairo and ended the Abbasid Caliphate. Arabs did not feel the change of administration because the Ottomans modeled their rule after the previous Arab administration systems. After World War I when the Ottoman Empire was overthrown by the British Empire former Ottoman colonies were divided up between the British and French as League of Nations mandates.

===Modern===
Arabs in modern times live in the Arab world which comprises 22 countries in Western Asia North Africa and parts of the Horn of Africa. They are all modern states and became significant as distinct political entities after the fall and defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire (1908–1922).

691,ASCII art,Other text-based visual art,"There are a variety of other types of art using text symbols from character sets other than ASCII and/or some form of color coding. Despite not being pure ASCII these are still often referred to as ""ASCII art"". The character set portion designed specifically for drawing is known as the line drawing characters or pseudo-graphics.

===ANSI art===

The IBM PC graphics hardware in text mode uses 16 bits per character. It supports a variety of configurations but in its default mode under DOS they are used to give 256 glyphs from one of the IBM PC code pages (Code page 437 by default) 16 foreground colors eight background colors and a flash option. Such art can be loaded into screen memory directly. ANSI.SYS if loaded also allows such art to be placed on screen by outputting escape sequences that indicate movements of the screen cursor and color/flash changes. If this method is used then the art becomes known as ANSI art. The IBM PC code pages also include characters intended for simple drawing which often made this art appear much cleaner than that made with more traditional character sets. Plain text files are also seen with these characters though they have become far less common since Windows GUI text editors (using the Windows ANSI code page) have largely replaced DOS based ones.

===Shift_JIS===

A large character selection and the availability of fixed-width characters allow Japanese users to use Shift JIS as a text-based art on Japanese websites.

====Special circumstances of Japan====

In Japan ASCII-art (AA) is mainly known as '''Shift-JIS Art'''.



In other words the word ''ASCII'' is used to refer to the ASCII Corporation rather than the American Standard Code for Information Interchange.

===Unicode===

Unicode would seem to offer the ultimate flexibility in producing text based art with its huge variety of characters. However finding a suitable fixed-width font is likely to be difficult if a significant subset of Unicode is desired. (Modern UNIX-style operating systems do provide complete fixed-width Unicode fonts e.g. for xterm. Windows has the Courier New font which includes characters like ┌╥─╨┐♥☺Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ) Also the common practice of rendering Unicode with a mixture of variable width fonts is likely to make predictable display hard if more than a tiny subset of Unicode is used. ≽ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ≼ is an adequate representation of a cat's face in a font with varying character widths.

====Control and combining characters====

The combining characters mechanism of Unicode provides considerable ways of customizing the style even obfuscating the text (e.g. via an online generator like  Obfuscator which focuses on the  filters). '''Glitcher''' is one example of '''Unicode art''' initiated in 2012: « ''These symbols intruding up and down are made by combining lots of diacritical marks. It’s a kind of art. There’s quite a lot of artists who use the Internet or specific social networks as their canvas.'' » The corresponding creations are favored in web browsers (thanks to their always better  support) as geekily stylized usernames for social networks. With a fair compatibility and among different online tools ''' Facebook symbols''' showcases various types of Unicode art mainly for aesthetic purpose (Ɯıḳĭƥḙȡḯả Wîkipêȡıẚ Ẉǐḳîṗȅḍȉā Ẃįḵįṗẻḑìẵ Ẉĭḵɪṕḗdïą Ẇïƙỉpểɗĭà Ẅȉḱïṕȩđĩẵ etc.). Besides the creations can be hand-crafted (by programming) or pasted from mobile applications (e.g. the category of  'fancy text' tools on Android). The underlying technique dates back to the old systems that incorporated control characters though. E.g. the German composite ö would be imitated on ZX Spectrum by  overwriting "" after backspace and o. (Cf. below.)

===Overprinting (surprint)===
In the 1970s and early 1980s it was popular to produce a kind of text art that relied on overprinting. This could be produced either on a screen or on a printer by typing a character backing up and then typing another character just as on a typewriter. This developed into sophisticated graphics in some cases such as the PLATO system (c. 1973) where superscript and subscript allowed a wide variety of graphic effects. A common use were for emoticons with WOBTAX and VICTORY both producing convincing smiley faces. Overprinting had previously been used on typewriters but the low-resolution pixelation of characters on video terminals meant that overprinting here produced seamless pixel graphics rather than visibly overstruck combinations of letters on paper.

Beyond pixel graphics this was also used for printing photographs as the overall darkness of a particular character space dependent on how many characters as well as the choice of character were printed in a particular place. Thanks to the increased granularity of tone photographs were often converted to this type of printout. Even manual typewriters or daisy wheel printers could be used. The technique has fallen from popularity since all cheap printers can easily print photographs and a normal text file (or an e-mail message or Usenet posting) cannot represent overprinted text. However something similar has emerged to replace it: shaded or colored ASCII art using ANSI video terminal markup or color codes (such as those found in HTML IRC and many internet message boards) to add a bit more tone variation. In this way it is possible to create ASCII art where the characters only differ in color.

881,Armenian language,Classification and origins,"




Armenian is an independent branch of the Indo-European languages. It is of interest to linguists for its distinctive phonological developments within that family. Armenian exhibits more satemization than centumization although it is not classified as belonging to either of these subgroups. Some linguists tentatively conclude that Armenian Greek (Phrygian) Albanian and Indo-Iranian were dialectally close to each other; within this hypothetical dialect group Proto-Armenian was situated between Proto-Greek (centum subgroup) and Proto-Indo-Iranian (satem subgroup).

Armenia was a monolingual country by the 2nd century BC at the latest. Its language has a long literary history with a 5th-century Bible translation as its oldest surviving text. Its vocabulary has been influenced by Western Middle Iranian languages particularly Parthian and to a lesser extent by Greek Persian and Arabic throughout its history. There are two standardized modern literary forms Eastern Armenian and Western Armenian with which most contemporary dialects are mutually intelligible.

Although the Armenians were known to history much earlier (for example they were mentioned in the 6th century BC Behistun Inscription and in Xenophon's 4th century BC history ''The Anabasis'') the oldest surviving Armenian-language text is the 5th century AD Bible translation of Mesrop Mashtots who created the Armenian alphabet in 405 AD at which time it had 36 letters. He is also credited by some with the creation of the Caucasian Albanian alphabet. In ''The Anabasis'' Xenophon describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC. He relates that the Armenian people spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the Persians.

===Early contacts===
W. M. Austin (1942) concluded that there was an early contact between Armenian and Anatolian languages based on what he considered common archaisms such as the lack of a feminine gender and the absence of inherited long vowels. However unlike shared innovations (or ''synapomorphies'') the common retention of archaisms (or ''symplesiomorphy'') is not considered conclusive evidence of a period of common isolated development.

Soviet linguist Igor M. Diakonoff (1985) noted the presence in Classical Armenian of what he calls a ""Caucasian substratum"" identified by earlier scholars consisting of loans from the Kartvelian and Northeast Caucasian languages. Noting that Hurro-Urartian-speaking peoples inhabited the Armenian homeland in the second millennium BC Diakonov identifies in Armenian a Hurro-Urartian substratum of social cultural and animal and plant terms such as ''ałaxin'' ""slave girl"" ( ← Hurr. ''al(l)a(e)ḫḫenne'') ''cov'' ""sea"" ( ← Urart. ''ṣûǝ'' ""(inland) sea"") ''ułt'' ""camel"" ( ← Hurr. ''uḷtu'') and ''xnjor'' ""apple(tree)"" ( ← Hurr. ''ḫinzuri''). Some of the terms he gives admittedly have an Akkadian or Sumerian provenance but he suggests they were borrowed through Hurrian or Urartian. Given that these borrowings do not undergo sound changes characteristic of the development of Armenian from Proto-Indo-European he dates their borrowing to a time before the written record but after the Proto-Armenian language stage.

Loan words from Iranian languages along with the other ancient accounts such as that of Xenophon above initially led linguists to erroneously classify Armenian as an Iranian language. Scholars such as Paul de Lagarde and F. Müller believed that the similarities between the two languages meant that Iranian and Armenian were the same language. The distinctness of Armenian was recognized when philologist Heinrich Hübschmann (1875) used the comparative method to distinguish two layers of Iranian loans from the older Armenian vocabulary. He showed that Armenian often had 2 morphemes for the one concept and the non-Iranian components yielded a consistent PIE pattern distinct from Iranian and also demonstrated that the inflectional morphology was different from that in Iranian languages.

===Graeco-Armenian hypothesis===


The hypothesis that Greek is Armenian's closest living relative originates with Holger Pedersen (1924) who noted that the number of Greek-Armenian lexical cognates is greater than that of agreements between Armenian and any other Indo-European language. Antoine Meillet (1925 1927) further investigated morphological and phonological agreement postulating that the parent languages of Greek and Armenian were dialects in immediate geographical proximity in the Proto-Indo-European period. Meillet's hypothesis became popular in the wake of his ''Esquisse'' (1936). Georg Renatus Solta (1960) does not go as far as postulating a Proto-Graeco-Armenian stage but he concludes that considering both the lexicon and morphology Greek is clearly the dialect most closely related to Armenian. Eric P. Hamp (1976 91) supports the Graeco-Armenian thesis anticipating even a time ""when we should speak of Helleno-Armenian"" (meaning the postulate of a Graeco-Armenian proto-language). Armenian shares the augment and a negator derived from the set phrase Proto-Indo-European language  (""never anything"" or ""always nothing"") and the representation of word-initial laryngeals by prothetic vowels and other phonological and morphological peculiarities with Greek. Nevertheless as Fortson (2004) comments ""by the time we reach our earliest Armenian records in the 5th century AD the evidence of any such early kinship has been reduced to a few tantalizing pieces"".

===Greco-Armeno-Aryan hypothesis===


Graeco-(Armeno)-Aryan is a hypothetical clade within the Indo-European family ancestral to the Greek language the Armenian language and the Indo-Iranian languages.  Graeco-Aryan unity would have become divided into Proto-Greek and Proto-Indo-Iranian by the mid-third millennium BC. Conceivably Proto-Armenian would have been located between Proto-Greek and Proto-Indo-Iranian consistent with the fact that Armenian shares certain features only with Indo-Iranian (the ''satem'' change) but others only with Greek (''s'' > ''h'').

Graeco-Aryan has comparatively wide support among Indo-Europeanists for the Indo-European homeland to be located in the Armenian Highlands the ""Armenian hypothesis"". Early and strong evidence was given by Euler's 1979 examination on shared features in Greek and Sanskrit nominal flection.

Used in tandem with the Graeco-Armenian hypothesis the Armenian language would also be included under the label '''Aryano-Greco-Armenic''' splitting into proto-Greek/Phrygian and ""Armeno-Aryan"" (ancestor of Armenian and Indo-Iranian).

583,Ambergris,Introduction,"
Ambergris
Ambergris from the North Sea
'''Ambergris''' ( or   ) ''ambergrease'' or ''grey amber'' is a solid waxy flammable substance of a dull grey or blackish colour produced in the digestive system of sperm whales.

Freshly-produced ambergris has a marine fecal odour.  However as it ages it acquires a sweet earthy scent commonly likened to the fragrance of rubbing alcohol without the vaporous chemical astringency. Although ambergris used to be very highly valued by perfumers as a fixative (allowing the scent to last much longer) it has now largely been replaced by synthetic ambroxan.
"
86,Android (robot),Introduction,"

 
An '''android''' is a humanoid robot or synthetic organism designed to look and act like a human especially one with a body having a flesh-like resemblance. Historically androids remained completely within the domain of science fiction where they are frequently seen in film and television. Only recently have advancements in robot technology allowed the design of functional and realistic humanoid robots.

Alaska is not divided into counties as most of the other U.S. states but it is divided into ''boroughs''. Many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of Alaska's 16 boroughs which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states. However unlike county-equivalents in the other 49 states the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state. The area not part of any borough is referred to as the Unorganized Borough.

The Unorganized Borough has no government of its own but the U.S. Census Bureau in cooperation with the state divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 census areas solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation. A ''recording district'' is a mechanism for administration of the public record in Alaska. The state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a State Recorder. All recording districts use the same acceptance criteria fee schedule etc. for accepting documents into the public record.

Whereas many U.S. states use a three-tiered system of decentralization—state/county/township—most of Alaska uses only two tiers—state/borough. Owing to the low population density most of the land is located in the Unorganized Borough. As the name implies it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government. In 2000 57.71% of Alaska's area has this status with 13.05% of the population.

Anchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975 to form the Municipality of Anchorage containing the city proper and the communities of Eagle River Chugiak Peters Creek Girdwood Bird and Indian. Fairbanks has a separate borough (the Fairbanks North Star Borough) and municipality (the City of Fairbanks).

The state's most populous city is Anchorage home to 278700 people in 2006 225744 of whom live in the urbanized area. The richest location in Alaska by per capita income is Halibut Cove ($89895). Yakutat City Sitka Juneau and Anchorage are the four largest cities in the U.S. by area.

===Cities and census-designated places (by population)===
As reflected in the 2010 United States Census Alaska has a total of 355 incorporated cities and census-designated places (CDPs).  The tally of cities includes four unified municipalities essentially the equivalent of a consolidated city–county. The majority of these communities are located in the rural expanse of Alaska known as ""The Bush"" and are unconnected to the contiguous North American road network. The table at the bottom of this section lists the 100 largest cities and census-designated places in Alaska in population order.

Of Alaska's 2010 Census population figure of 710231 20429 people or 2.88% of the population did not live in an incorporated city or census-designated place. Approximately three-quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of Ketchikan Kodiak Palmer and Wasilla.  CDPs have not been established for these areas by the United States Census Bureau except that seven CDPs were established for the Ketchikan-area neighborhoods in the 1980 Census (Clover Pass Herring Cove Ketchikan East Mountain Point North Tongass Highway Pennock Island and Saxman East) but have not been used since. The remaining population was scattered throughout Alaska both within organized boroughs and in the Unorganized Borough in largely remote areas.

633,Arthritis,History,"Evidence of osteoarthritis and potentially inflammatory arthritis has been discovered in dinosaurs. The first known traces of human arthritis date back as far as 4500 BC. In early reports arthritis was frequently referred to as the most common ailment of prehistoric peoples. It was noted in skeletal remains of Native Americans found in Tennessee and parts of what is now Olathe Kansas. Evidence of arthritis has been found throughout history from Ötzi a mummy (circa 3000 BC) found along the border of modern Italy and Austria to the Egyptian mummies circa 2590 BC.

In 1715 William Musgrave published the second edition of his most important medical work ''De arthritide symptomatica'' which concerned arthritis and its effects.

459,Aachen,Geography,"The three-country point where the borders of Germany Belgium and the Netherlands meet

Aachen is located in the middle of the Meuse–Rhine Euroregion close to the border tripoint of Germany the Netherlands and Belgium. The city of Heerlen in the Netherlands lies nearby as does Eupen the capital of the German-speaking Community of Belgium both located about  from Aachen's city centre. Aachen lies near the head of the open valley of the River Wurm (which today flows through the city in canalised form) part of the larger basin of the River Meuse and about  north of the High Fens which form the northern edge of the Eifel uplands of the Rhenish Massif.

The maximum dimensions of the city's territory are  from north to south and  from east to west. The city limits are  long of which  border Belgium and  the Netherlands. The highest point in Aachen located in the far southeast of the city lies at an elevation of 410 m above sea level. The lowest point in the north and on the border with the Netherlands is at 125 m.

=== Climate ===
As the westernmost city in Germany (and close to the Low Countries) Aachen and the surrounding area belongs to a temperate climate zone with humid weather mild winters and warm summers. Because of its location north of the Eifel and the High Fens and its subsequent prevailing westerly weather patterns rainfall in Aachen (on average 805 mm/year) is comparatively higher than for example in Bonn (with 669 mm/year). Another factor in the local weather forces of Aachen is the occurrence of Foehn winds on the southerly air currents which results from the city's geographic location on the northern edge of the Eifel.

Because the city is surrounded by hills it suffers from inversion-related smog. Some areas of the city have become urban heat islands as a result of poor heat exchange both because of the area's natural geography and from human activity. The city's numerous cold air corridors which are slated to remain as free as possible from new construction therefore play an important role in the urban climate of Aachen.

The January average is
 while the July average is . Precipitation is almost evenly spread throughout the year.

100,Abortion,Incidence,"There are two commonly used methods of measuring the incidence of abortion:
* Abortion rate – number of abortions per 1000 women between 15 and 44 years of age
* Abortion percentage – number of abortions out of 100 known pregnancies (pregnancies include live births abortions and miscarriages)

In many places where abortion is illegal or carries a heavy social stigma medical reporting of abortion is not reliable.  For this reason estimates of the incidence of abortion must be made without determining certainty related to standard error.

The number of abortions performed worldwide seems to have remained stable in recent years with 41.6 million having been performed in 2003 and 43.8 million having been performed in 2008. The abortion rate worldwide was 28 per 1000 women though it was 24 per 1000 women for developed countries and 29 per 1000 women for developing countries. The same 2012 study indicated that in 2008 the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21% worldwide with 26% in developed countries and 20% in developing countries.

On average the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion. However restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions which are performed unsafely. The unsafe abortion rate in developing countries is partly attributable to lack of access to modern contraceptives; according to the Guttmacher Institute providing access to contraceptives would result in about 14.5 million fewer unsafe abortions and 38000 fewer deaths from unsafe abortion annually worldwide.

The rate of legal induced abortion varies extensively worldwide. According to the report of employees of Guttmacher Institute it ranged from 7 per 1000 women (Germany and Switzerland) to 30 per 1000 women (Estonia) in countries with complete statistics in 2008. The proportion of pregnancies that ended in induced abortion ranged from about 10% (Israel the Netherlands and Switzerland) to 30% (Estonia) in the same group though it might be as high as 36% in Hungary and Romania whose statistics were deemed incomplete.

The abortion rate may also be expressed as the average number of abortions a woman has during her reproductive years; this is referred to as ''total abortion rate'' (TAR).

===Gestational age and method===


Abortion rates also vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method practiced. In 2003 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 26% of abortions in the United States were known to have been obtained at less than 6 weeks' gestation 18% at 7 weeks 15% at 8 weeks 18% at 9 through 10 weeks 9.7% at 11 through 12 weeks 6.2% at 13 through 15 weeks 4.1% at 16 through 20 weeks and 1.4% at more than 21 weeks. 90.9% of these were classified as having been done by ""curettage"" (suction-aspiration dilation and curettage dilation and evacuation) 7.7% by ""medical"" means (mifepristone) 0.4% by ""intrauterine instillation"" (saline or prostaglandin) and 1.0% by ""other"" (including hysterotomy and hysterectomy). According to the CDC due to data collection difficulties the data must be viewed as tentative and some fetal deaths reported beyond 20 weeks may be natural deaths erroneously classified as abortions if the removal of the dead fetus is accomplished by the same procedure as an induced abortion.

The Guttmacher Institute estimated there were 2200 intact dilation and extraction procedures in the US during 2000; this accounts for 0.17% of the total number of abortions performed that year. Similarly in England and Wales in 2006 89% of terminations occurred at or under 12 weeks 9% between 13 and 19 weeks and 1.5% at or over 20 weeks. 64% of those reported were by vacuum aspiration 6% by D&E and 30% were medical. There are more second trimester abortions in developing countries such as China India and Vietnam than in developed countries.

967,Ardal O'Hanlon,Career,"Together with Kevin Gildea and Barry Murphy O'Hanlon founded the International Comedy Cellar upstairs in the International Bar on Dublin's South Wicklow Street. Dublin had no comedy scene at the time. As a stand up O'Hanlon won the Hackney Empire New Act of the Year competition in 1994. For a time he was the presenter of ''The Stand Up Show''.

He was spotted by Graham Linehan who was to cast him as Father Dougal McGuire in ''Father Ted'' (1995–98). In 1995 he received the Top TV Comedy Newcomer at the British Comedy Awards for this role. In 1995 he appeared (as Father Dougal) in a Channel 4 ident (""Hello you're watching.... television"") and during Comic Relief on BBC1. This was followed by the award-winning short comedy film ''Flying Saucer Rock'n'Roll''.

O'Hanlon moved into straight acting alongside Emma Fielding and Beth Goddard in the ITV comedy-drama ''Big Bad World'' which aired for two series in summer 1999 and winter 2001. He also played a minor role in ''The Butcher Boy'' as Joe's (Francie's best friend) father and appeared in an episode of the original ''Whose Line is it Anyway?''.

In 2000 O'Hanlon starred in the comedy series ''My Hero'' in which he played a very naive superhero from the planet Ultron. His character juggled world-saving heroics with life in suburbia. He stayed in the role until the first episode of series 6 in July 2006 where he was replaced by James Dreyfus during the same episode.

He also provided the voice of the lead character in the three Christmas television cartoon specials of ''Robbie the Reindeer''. He appeared in the 2005 BBC One sitcom ''Blessed'' written by Ben Elton; at the 2005 British Comedy Awards it was publicly slated by Jonathan Ross albeit in jest. Towards the end of 2005 he played an eccentric Scottish character Coconut Tam in the family-based film ''The Adventures of Greyfriars Bobby''. Although more commonly on television he has appeared on radio  – on 18 July 2011 he appeared on ''Quote... Unquote''. Appropriately one of his questions concerned a quotation from ''Father Ted''.

In 2006 O'Hanlon wrote and presented an RTÉ television series called ''Leagues Apart'' which saw him investigate the biggest and most passionate football rivalries in a number of European countries. Included were Roma vs Lazio in Italy Barcelona vs Real Madrid in Spain and Galatasaray vs Fenerbahce in Turkey. He followed this with another RTÉ show ''So You Want To Be Taoiseach?'' in 2007. It was a political series where O'Hanlon gave tongue-in-cheek advice on how to go about becoming Taoiseach of Ireland. Both programmes went some way towards freeing O'Hanlon from his association with the character of Dougal in the minds of Irish audiences.

He appeared in the ''Doctor Who'' episode ""Gridlock"" broadcast on 14 April 2007 in which he played a cat-like creature named Thomas Kincade Brannigan. O'Hanlon appears in Series 3 of the TV show ''Skins'' playing Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless)'s Politics teacher named Kieran who attempted to kiss her. He then went on to form a relationship with Naomi's mother (Olivia Colman). O'Hanlon plays the lead role in Irish comedy television programme ''Val Falvey TD'' on RTÉ One. He has recently performed in the Edinburgh Fringe.

In February 2011 O'Hanlon returned to the Gate Theatre Dublin starring in the Irish premiere of Christopher Hampton's translation of Yasmina Reza's ''God of Carnage'' alongside Maura Tierney.

In 2011 he appeared in the comedy panel show ''Argumental''.

O'Hanlon has written a novel ''The Talk of the Town'' (known in the United States as ''Knick Knack Paddy Whack'') which was published in 1998. The novel is about a teenage boy Patrick Scully and his friends.

In February 2015 he officially launched the 2015 Sky Cat Laughs Comedy Festival which takes place in Kilkenny from 28 May–1 June. In 2015 he played the role of Peter the Milkman in the Sky 1 sitcom ''After Hours''.

On 2 February 2017 it was announced he will play the lead role in the BBC crime sitcom ''Death in Paradise'' taking the role of DI Jack Mooney following Kris Marshall's departure the same day.

858,Ahmad Shah Massoud,Personal life,"Massoud was married to Sediqa Massoud. They have one son Ahmad Massoud (born in 1989) and five daughters (Fatima born in 1992 Mariam born in 1993 Ayesha born in 1995 Zohra born in 1996 and Nasrine born in 1998). In 2005 Sediqa Massoud published a personal account on her life with Massoud (co-authored by two women's rights activists and friends of Sediqa Massoud Chékéba Hachemi and ) called ''""Pour l'amour de Massoud""'' (For the love of Massoud) in which she describes a decent and loving husband.

The family has a great deal of prestige in the politics of Afghanistan. One of his six brothers Ahmad Zia Massoud was the Vice President of Afghanistan from 2004 until 2009 under the first democratically elected government of Afghanistan. Unsuccessful attempts have been made on the life of Ahmad Zia Massoud in 2004 and late 2009. The Associated Press reported that 8 Afghans died in the attempt on Ahmad Zia Massoud's life. Ahmad Zia Massoud leads the National Front of Afghanistan (a United Front group).

Another brother Ahmad Wali Massoud was Afghanistan's Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 2002 to 2006. He is a member of Abdullah Abdullah's National Coalition of Afghanistan (another United Front group).

6,Abraham Lincoln,Presidency,"

===1860 election and secession===


On November 6 1860 Lincoln was elected the 16th president of the United States beating Douglas Breckinridge and Bell. He was the first president from the Republican Party. His victory was entirely due to the strength of his support in the North and West; no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states.

Lincoln received 1866452 votes Douglas 1376957 votes Breckinridge 849781 votes and Bell 588789 votes. Turnout was 82.2 percent with Lincoln winning the free Northern states as well as California and Oregon. Douglas won Missouri and split New Jersey with Lincoln. Bell won Virginia Tennessee and Kentucky and Breckinridge won the rest of the South.

Although Lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote his victory in the electoral college was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. There were fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York New Jersey and Rhode Island but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College.

The first photographic image of the new president
As Lincoln's election became evident secessionists made clear their intent to leave the Union before he took office the next March. On December 20 1860 South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1 1861 Florida Mississippi Alabama Georgia Louisiana and Texas followed. Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation the Confederate States of America. The upper South and border states (Delaware Maryland Virginia North Carolina Tennessee Kentucky Missouri and Arkansas) listened to but initially rejected the secessionist appeal. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy declaring secession illegal. The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its provisional President on February 9 1861.

There were attempts at compromise. The Crittenden Compromise would have extended the Missouri Compromise line of 1820 dividing the territories into slave and free contrary to the Republican Party's free-soil platform. Lincoln rejected the idea saying ""I will suffer death before I consent ... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right.""

Lincoln however did tacitly support the proposed Corwin Amendment to the Constitution which passed Congress before Lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states. That proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that Congress would not interfere with slavery without Southern consent. A few weeks before the war Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution. Lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the Constitution.

En route to his inauguration by train Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North. The president-elect then evaded possible assassins in Baltimore who were uncovered by Lincoln's head of security Allan Pinkerton. On February 23 1861 he arrived in disguise in Washington D.C. which was placed under substantial military guard. Lincoln directed his inaugural address to the South proclaiming once again that he had no intention or inclination to abolish slavery in the Southern states:

The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: ""We are not enemies but friends. We must not be enemies ... The mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature."" The failure of the Peace Conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible. By March 1861 no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated. Lincoln said as the war was ending:
:Both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war came.

===Beginning of the war===

Major Anderson Ft. Sumter commander

The commander of Fort Sumter South Carolina Major Robert Anderson sent a request for provisions to Washington and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. On April 12 1861 Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter forcing them to surrender and began the war. Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion.

William Tecumseh Sherman talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was ""sadly disappointed"" at his failure to realize that ""the country was sleeping on a volcano"" and that the South was preparing for war. Historian Donald concludes that ""His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he also vowed not to surrender the forts. The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that.""

On April 15 Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75000 troops to recapture forts protect Washington and ""preserve the Union"" which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. This call forced the states to choose sides. Virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the Confederate capital despite the exposed position of Richmond so close to Union lines. North Carolina Tennessee and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland but did not prevail; Kentucky tried to be neutral. The Confederate attack on Fort Sumter rallied Americans north of the Mason-Dixon line to the defense of the American nation. Historian Allan Nevins says: 
:The thunderclap of Sumter produced a startling crystallization of Northern sentiment ... Anger swept the land. From every side came news of mass meetings speeches resolutions tenders of business support the muster of companies and regiments the determined action of governors and legislatures.""

States sent Union regiments south in response to Lincoln's call to save the capital and confront the rebellion. On April 19 mobs in Baltimore which controlled the rail links attacked Union troops who were changing trains and local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital. The Army responded by arresting local Maryland officials. Lincoln suspended the writ of ''habeas corpus'' in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach Washington. John Merryman a Maryland official involved in hindering the U.S. troop movements petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice and Marylander Roger B. Taney author of the controversial pro-slavery ''Dred Scott'' opinion to issue a writ of ''habeas corpus'' and in June Taney acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the Supreme Court issued the writ because in his opinion only Congress could suspend the writ. Lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the Ex parte Merryman ruling.

===War strategy===
After the Battle of Fort Sumter Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis and he responded as commander-in-chief using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress and after suspending ''habeas corpus'' arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.

''Running the 'Machine'' : An 1864 political cartoon satirizing Lincoln's administration—featuring William Fessenden Edwin Stanton William Seward Gideon Welles Lincoln and others.
The war effort was the source of continued disparagement of Lincoln and dominated his time and attention. From the start it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6 1861 Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice the law had little effect but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.

In late August 1861 General John C. Frémont the 1856 Republican presidential nominee issued without consulting his superiors in Washington a proclamation of martial law in Missouri. He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court-martialed and shot and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed. Frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the Department of the West compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption. Lincoln overruled Frémont's proclamation. Lincoln believed that Fremont's emancipation was political; neither militarily necessary nor legal. After Lincoln acted Union enlistments from Maryland Kentucky and Missouri increased by over 40000 troops.

Lincoln left most diplomatic matters to his Secretary of State William Seward. At times Seward was too bellicose so for balance Lincoln stuck a close working relationship with Senator Charles Sumner the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Trent Affair of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain. The U.S. Navy had illegally intercepted a British mail ship the ''Trent'' on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats. Biographer James G. Randall has dissected Lincoln's successful techniques:
:his restraint his avoidance of any outward expression of truculence his early softening of State Department's attitude toward Britain his deference toward Seward and Sumner his withholding of his own paper prepared for the occasion his readiness to arbitrate his golden silence in addressing Congress his shrewdness in recognizing that war must be averted and his clear perception that a point could be clinched for America's true position at the same time that full satisfaction was given to a friendly country.

Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the War Department headquarters.  He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort consulted with governors and selected generals based on their past success (as well as their state and party). In January 1862 after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department Lincoln replaced Simon Cameron with Edwin Stanton as War Secretary. Stanton was a staunchly Unionist pro-business conservative Democrat who moved toward the Radical Republican faction. Nevertheless he worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than any other senior official. ""Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together"" say Thomas and Hyman.

In terms of war strategy Lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that Washington was well-defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days. Twice a week Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard. Lincoln learned from reading the theoretical book of his chief of staff General Henry Halleck a disciple of the European strategist Jomini; he began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points such as the Mississippi River. Lincoln saw the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army rather than simply capturing territory.

===General McClellan===
After the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and the retirement of the aged Winfield Scott in late 1861 Lincoln appointed Major General George B. McClellan general-in-chief of all the Union armies. McClellan a young West Point graduate railroad executive and Pennsylvania Democrat took several months to plan and attempt his Peninsula Campaign longer than Lincoln wanted. The campaign's objective was to capture Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital. McClellan's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops in defense of the capital; McClellan who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.

George McClellan after the Battle of Antietam in 1862

Lincoln removed McClellan as general-in-chief in March 1862 after McClellan's ""Harrison's Landing Letter"" in which he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. The office remained empty until July when Henry Halleck was selected for it. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope a Republican as head of the new Army of Virginia. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack.

However lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan now commanding the Army of the Potomac Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862 forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the CSS ''Virginia'' formerly the USS ''Merrimack'' damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk Virginia before being engaged and damaged by the USS ''Monitor''. Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the Battle of Hampton Roads.

Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope Lincoln was desperate and restored him to command of all forces around Washington to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward. Two days after McClellan's return to command General Robert E. Lee's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862. The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation.

McClellan then resisted the President's demand that he pursue Lee's retreating and exposed army while his counterpart General Don Carlos Buell likewise refused orders to move the Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. As a result Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans; and after the 1862 midterm elections he replaced McClellan with Republican Ambrose Burnside. Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander-in-Chief.

battle of May 3 1863
Burnside against the advice of the president prematurely launched an offensive across the Rappahannock River and was stunningly defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg in December. Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg. Lincoln brought in Joseph Hooker despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship.

The mid-term elections in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war as well as rising inflation new high taxes rumors of corruption the suspension of ''habeas corpus'' the military draft law and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest.

While Republicans were discouraged Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania Ohio Indiana and New York. The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states except New York. The Cincinnati ''Gazette'' contended that the voters were ""depressed by the interminable nature of this war as so far conducted and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress"".

In the spring of 1863 Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included Hooker's attack on Lee north of Richmond Rosecrans' on Chattanooga Grant's on Vicksburg and a naval assault on Charleston.

Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May but continued to command his troops for some weeks. He ignored Lincoln's order to divide his troops and possibly force Lee to do the same in Harper's Ferry and tendered his resignation which Lincoln accepted. He was replaced by George Meade who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign which was a victory for the Union though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time after initial setbacks Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor.
After the Battle of Gettysburg Lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals who resented his civilian interference with their own plans. Even so he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander-in-Chief.

===Emancipation Proclamation===


''First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln'' by Francis Bicknell Carpenter (1864)|alt=A dark-haired bearded middle-aged man holding documents is seated among seven other men.

Lincoln understood that the Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution which before 1865 committed the issue to individual states. He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory. At the beginning of the war he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery. Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it as envisioned by the Founding Fathers under the constitution. President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C. Frémont in August 1861 and by Major General David Hunter in May 1862 on the grounds that it was not within their power and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.

On June 19 1862 endorsed by Lincoln Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory. In July the Confiscation Act of 1862 was passed which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion. Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress's power to free the slaves within the states he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. He felt such action could only be taken by the Commander-in-Chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution and Lincoln was planning to take that action. In that month Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet. In it he stated that ""as a fit and necessary military measure on January 1 1863 all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward and forever be free"".

Privately Lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the Confederacy had to be eliminated. However Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. Republican editor Horace Greeley of the highly influential ''New York Tribune'' fell for the ploy and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22 1862. Although he said he personally wished all men could be free Lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as the U.S. president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his ""official duty"") was that of preserving the Union:



The Emancipation Proclamation issued on September 22 1862 and put into effect on January 1 1863 declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states. Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.

Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective as Union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: ""I never in my life felt more certain that I was doing right than I do in signing this paper."" For some time Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. A few days after Emancipation was announced 13 Republican governors met at the War Governors' Conference; they supported the president's Proclamation but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army.

Enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation. By the spring of 1863 Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to Andrew Johnson the military governor of Tennessee encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops Lincoln wrote ""The bare sight of 50000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once"". By the end of 1863 at Lincoln's direction General Lorenzo Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley. Frederick Douglass once observed of Lincoln: ""In his company I was never reminded of my humble origin or of my unpopular color"".

===Gettysburg Address (1863)===

the speech
With the great Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863 and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort despite the New York City draft riots. The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19 1863. Defying Lincoln's prediction that ""the world will little note nor long remember what we say here"" the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.

In 272 words and three minutes Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789 but in 1776 ""conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal"". He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain that slavery would end as a result of the losses and the future of democracy in the world would be assured that ""government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth"". Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.

===General Grant===

Meade's failure to capture Lee's army as it retreated from Gettysburg and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed. General Ulysses S. Grant's victories at the Battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh Lincoln had said ""I can't spare this man. He fights."" With Grant in command Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops.

Nevertheless Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864 as McClellan was. Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant's political intentions and being assured that he had none submitted to the Senate Grant's promotion to commander of the Union Army. He obtained Congress's consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General which no officer had held since George Washington.

Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864. This is often characterized as a war of attrition given high Union losses at battles such as the Battle of the Wilderness and Cold Harbor. Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive the Confederate forces had ""almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces"". The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North; Grant had lost a third of his army and Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were to which the general replied ""I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.""

The Confederacy lacked reinforcements so Lee's army shrank with every costly battle. Grant's army moved south crossed the James River forcing a siege and trench warfare outside Petersburg Virginia. Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point Virginia. This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina. Lincoln and the Republican Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North and replaced the Union losses.

Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure—such as plantations railroads and bridges—hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. Grant's move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South. This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and Philip Sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. The damage caused by Sherman's March to the Sea through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a  swath but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal but rather defeat of the Confederate armies. Mark E. Neely Jr. has argued that there was no effort to engage in ""total war"" against civilians which he believed did take place during World War II.

Confederate general Jubal Early began a series of assaults in the North that threatened the Capital. During Early's raid on Washington D.C. in 1864 Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; Captain Oliver Wendell Holmes shouted at him ""Get down you damn fool before you get shot!"" After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched.

As Grant continued to wear down Lee's forces efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President Stephens led a group to meet with Lincoln Seward and others at Hampton Roads. Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results. On April 1 1865 Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the Battle of Five Forks and nearly encircled Petersburg and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond. Days later when that city fell Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as he walked through the city white Southerners were stone-faced but freedmen greeted him as a hero. On April 9 Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox and the war was effectively over.

===1864 re-election===



While the war was still being waged Lincoln faced reelection in 1864. Lincoln was a master politician bringing together—and holding together—all the main factions of the Republican Party and bringing in War Democrats such as Edwin M. Stanton and Andrew Johnson as well. Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers—greatly expanded over peacetime—to hold the factions of his party together build support for his own policies and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket. At its 1864 convention the Republican Party selected Johnson a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party.

When Grant's 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted the lack of military success wore heavily on the President's re-election prospects and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Sharing this fear Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House:
 Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.



While the Democratic platform followed the ""Peace wing"" of the party and called the war a ""failure"" their candidate General George B. McClellan supported the war and repudiated the platform. Lincoln provided Grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of Grant in the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September and David Farragut's capture of Mobile ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. By contrast the National Union Party was united and energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue and state Republican parties stressed the perfidy of the Copperheads. On November 8 Lincoln was re-elected in a landslide carrying all but three states and receiving 78 percent of the Union soldiers' vote.

On March 4 1865 Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address. In it he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be God's will. Historian Mark Noll concludes it ranks ""among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world"". Lincoln said:



===Reconstruction===

Reconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. Shortly after Lee's surrender a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated and Lincoln replied ""Let 'em up easy."" In keeping with that sentiment Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy and was opposed by the Radical Republicans under Rep. Thaddeus Stevens Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen. Benjamin Wade political allies of the president on other issues. Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war. His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office had not mistreated Union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance.

A political cartoon of Vice President Andrew Johnson (a former tailor) and Lincoln 1865 entitled ''The 'Rail Splitter' At Work Repairing the Union''. The caption reads (Johnson): ""Take it quietly Uncle Abe and I will draw it closer than ever."" (Lincoln): ""A few more stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended.""

As Southern states were subdued critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors respectively. In Louisiana Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient and passed their own plan the Wade-Davis Bill in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana Arkansas and Tennessee.

Lincoln's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness. To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court he named the choice of the Radicals Salmon P. Chase who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies.

After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation which did not apply to every state Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment. Lincoln declared that such an amendment would ""clinch the whole matter"". By December 1863 a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to Congress for passage. This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass falling short of the required two-thirds majority on June 15 1864 in the House of Representatives. Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican/Unionist platform in the election of 1864. After a long debate in the House a second attempt passed Congress on January 31 1865 and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification. Upon ratification it became the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 6 1865.

As the war drew to a close Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's Freedmen's Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.

Historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what Lincoln would have done about Reconstruction if he had lived but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen. Lincoln biographers James G. Randall and Richard Current according to David Lincove argue that:
:It is likely that had he lived Lincoln would have followed a policy similar to Johnson's that he would have clashed with congressional Radicals that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred and that his political skills would have helped him avoid Johnson's mistakes.

Eric Foner argues that:
:Unlike Sumner and other Radicals Lincoln did not see Reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. He had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land. He believed as most Republicans did in April 1865 that the voting requirements should be determined by the states. He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists reluctant secessionists and forward-looking former Confederates. But time and again during the war Lincoln after initial opposition had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and Radical Republicans. ... Lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves ... It is entirely plausible to imagine Lincoln and Congress agreeing on a Reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage along the lines Lincoln proposed just before his death.""

===Redefining the republic and republicanism===
Lincoln in February 1865 about two months before his death

The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country. The term ""the United States"" has historically been used sometimes in the plural (""these United States"") and other times in the singular without any particular grammatical consistency. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.

In recent years historians such as Harry Jaffa Herman Belz John Diggins Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln's redefinition of ''republican values''. As early as the 1850s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the ""sheet anchor"" of republicanism. The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all in contrast to the Constitution's tolerance of slavery shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860 ""Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself."" His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms. Nevertheless in 1861 Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree) and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. Burton (2008) argues that Lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated.

In March 1861 in Lincoln's first inaugural address he explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system. He said ""A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people.""


===Other enactments===
Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction. He signed the Homestead Act in 1862 making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act also signed in 1862 provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad which was completed in 1869. The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.


Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent) and a new Federal income tax. In 1861 Lincoln signed the second and third Morrill Tariff the first having become law under James Buchanan. Also in 1861 Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861 creating the first U.S. income tax. This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($ in current dollar terms) which was later changed by the Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure.

Lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in several other areas. The creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Act provided a strong financial network in the country. It also established a national currency. In 1862 Congress created with Lincoln's approval the Department of Agriculture. In 1862 Lincoln sent a senior general John Pope to put down the ""Sioux Uprising"" in Minnesota. Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted Santee Dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved). President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy.

In the wake of Grant's casualties in his campaign against Lee Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft but it was never issued. In response to rumors of one however the editors of the ''New York World'' and the ''Journal of Commerce'' published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.

Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. Before Lincoln's presidency Thanksgiving while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates. The last such proclamation had been during James Madison's presidency 50 years before. In 1863 Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving. In June 1864 Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as Yosemite National Park.

===Judicial appointments===


====Supreme Court appointments====
* Noah Haynes Swayne – 1862
* Samuel Freeman Miller – 1862
* David Davis – 1862
* Stephen Johnson Field – 1863
* Salmon Portland Chase – 1864 (Chief Justice)

Salmon Portland Chase was Lincoln's choice to be Chief Justice of the United States.
Lincoln's declared philosophy on court nominations was that ""we cannot ask a man what he will do and if we should and he should answer us we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known."" Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court. Noah Haynes Swayne nominated January 21 1862 and appointed January 24 1862 was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union. Samuel Freeman Miller nominated and appointed on July 16 1862 supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. David Davis Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860 nominated December 1 1862 and appointed December 8 1862 had also served as a judge in Lincoln's Illinois court circuit. Stephen Johnson Field a previous California Supreme Court justice was nominated March 6 1863 and appointed March 10 1863 and provided geographic balance as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat. Finally Lincoln's Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase was nominated as Chief Justice and appointed the same day on December 6 1864. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist would support Reconstruction legislation and that his appointment united the Republican Party.

====Other judicial appointments====
Lincoln appointed 32 federal judges including four Associate Justices and one Chief Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States and 27 judges to the United States district courts. Lincoln appointed no judges to the United States circuit courts during his time in office.

===States admitted to the Union===
West Virginia admitted to the Union June 20 1863 contained the former north-westernmost counties of Virginia that seceded from Virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the Union. As a condition for its admission West Virginia's constitution was required to provide for the gradual abolition of slavery. Nevada which became the third State in the far-west of the continent was admitted as a free state on October 31 1864.

715,Antlia,Introduction,"



'''Antlia''' (; from Ancient Greek ''ἀντλία'') is a constellation in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere. Its name means ""pump"" in Latin; it represents an air pump. Originally '''Antlia Pneumatica''' the constellation was established by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century though its name was later abbreviated by John Herschel. Located close to the stars forming the old constellation of the ship Argo Navis Antlia is completely visible from latitudes south of 49 degrees north.

Antlia is a faint constellation; its brightest star is Alpha Antliae an orange giant that is a suspected variable star ranging between apparent magnitudes 4.22 and 4.29. S Antliae is an eclipsing binary star system changing in brightness as one star passes in front of the other. Sharing a common envelope the stars are so close they will one day merge to form a single star. Two star systems with known exoplanets HD 93083 and WASP-66 lie within Antlia as do NGC 2997 a spiral galaxy and the Antlia Dwarf Galaxy.

307,Atomic orbital,Transitions between orbitals,"
Bound quantum states have discrete energy levels. When applied to atomic orbitals this means that the energy differences between states are also discrete. A transition between these states (i.e. an electron absorbing or emitting a photon) can thus only happen if the photon has an energy corresponding with the exact energy difference between said states.

Consider two states of the hydrogen atom:

State 1)    and 

State 2)    and 

By quantum theory state 1 has a fixed energy of  and state 2 has a fixed energy of . Now what would happen if an electron in state 1 were to move to state 2? For this to happen the electron would need to gain an energy of exactly . If the electron receives energy that is less than or greater than this value it cannot jump from state 1 to state 2. Now suppose we irradiate the atom with a broad-spectrum of light. Photons that reach the atom that have an energy of exactly  will be absorbed by the electron in state 1 and that electron will jump to state 2. However photons that are greater or lower in energy cannot be absorbed by the electron because the electron can only jump to one of the orbitals it cannot jump to a state between orbitals. The result is that only photons of a specific frequency will be absorbed by the atom. This creates a line in the spectrum known as an absorption line which corresponds to the energy difference between states 1 and 2.

The atomic orbital model thus predicts line spectra which are observed experimentally. This is one of the main validations of the atomic orbital model.

The atomic orbital model is nevertheless an approximation to the full quantum theory which only recognizes many electron states. The predictions of line spectra are qualitatively useful but are not quantitatively accurate for atoms and ions other than those containing only one electron.

7,Aristotle,Thought,"
===Logic===
Aristotle as portrayed in the 1493 ''Nuremberg Chronicle''



With the ''Prior Analytics'' Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th century advances in mathematical logic. Kant stated in the ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (Preface to the Second Edition 1787) that with Aristotle logic reached its completion.

====History====
Aristotle ""says that 'on the subject of reasoning' he 'had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of'"". However Plato reports that syntax was devised before him by Prodicus of Ceos who was concerned by the correct use of words. Logic seems to have emerged from dialectics; the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like ''reductio ad absurdum'' in their discussions but never truly understood the logical implications. Even Plato had difficulties with logic; although he had a reasonable conception of a deductive system he could never actually construct one thus he relied instead on his dialectic.

Plato believed that deduction would simply follow from premises hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the conclusion would logically follow. Consequently Plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial. He never succeeded in devising such a method but his best attempt was published in his book ''Sophist'' where he introduced his division method.

====Analytics and the ''Organon''====

What we today call ''Aristotelian logic'' Aristotle himself would have labeled ""analytics"". The term ""logic"" he reserved to mean ''dialectics''. Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century CE:

# ''Categories''
# ''On Interpretation''
# ''Prior Analytics''
# ''Posterior Analytics''
# ''Topics''
# ''On Sophistical Refutations''

The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics the analysis of simple terms in the ''Categories'' the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in ''On Interpretation'' to the study of more complex forms namely syllogisms (in the ''Analytics'') and dialectics (in the ''Topics'' and ''Sophistical Refutations''). The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory ''stricto sensu'': the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning. There is one volume of Aristotle's concerning logic not found in the ''Organon'' namely the fourth book of ''Metaphysics.''

===Aristotle's epistemology===
Plato (left) and Aristotle (right) a detail of ''The School of Athens'' a fresco by Raphael. Aristotle gestures to the earth representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation and experience while holding a copy of his ''Nicomachean Ethics'' in his hand whilst Plato gestures to the heavens representing his belief in The Forms while holding a copy of ''Timaeus''.

Ancient Roman mosaic depicting Aristotle Römisch-Germanisches Museum Koln Germany
Like his teacher Plato Aristotle's philosophy aims at the universal. Aristotle's ontology however finds the universal in particular things which he calls the essence of things while in Plato's ontology the universal exists apart from particular things and is related to them as their prototype or exemplar. For Aristotle therefore epistemology is based on the study of particular phenomena and rises to the knowledge of essences while for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal Forms (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these. For Aristotle ""form"" still refers to the unconditional basis of phenomena but is ""instantiated"" in a particular substance (see ''Universals and particulars'' below). In a certain sense Aristotle's method is both inductive and deductive while Plato's is essentially deductive from ''a priori'' principles.

In Aristotle's terminology ""natural philosophy"" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics biology and other natural sciences. In modern times the scope of ''philosophy'' has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries such as ethics and metaphysics in which logic plays a major role. Today's philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method. In contrast Aristotle's philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry.

In the larger sense of the word Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning which he also would describe as ""science"". Note however that his use of the term ''science'' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term ""scientific method"". For Aristotle ""all science (''dianoia'') is either practical poetical or theoretical"" (''Metaphysics'' 1025b25). By practical science he means ethics and politics; by poetical science he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science he means physics mathematics and metaphysics.

If logic (or ""analytics"") is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of: (1) Logic; (2) Theoretical Philosophy including Metaphysics Physics and Mathematics; (3) Practical Philosophy and (4) Poetical Philosophy.

In the period between his two stays in Athens between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today. In fact most of Aristotle's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science. Aristotle's metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics. He did however perform original research in the natural sciences e.g. botany zoology physics astronomy chemistry meteorology and several other sciences.

Aristotle's writings on science are largely qualitative as opposed to quantitative. Beginning in the 16th century scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences and Aristotle's work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate. His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass velocity force and temperature. He had a conception of speed and temperature but no quantitative understanding of them which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices like clocks and thermometers.

His writings provide an account of many scientific observations a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors. For example in his ''History of Animals'' he claimed that human males have more teeth than females. In a similar vein John Philoponus and later Galileo showed by simple experiments that Aristotle's theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect. On the other hand Aristotle refuted Democritus's claim that the Milky Way was made up of ""those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays"" pointing out (correctly even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time) that given ""current astronomical demonstrations"" that ""the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun then ... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them.""

Aristotle also had some scientific blind spots. He posited a geocentric cosmology that we may discern in selections of the ''Metaphysics'' which was widely accepted up until the 16th century. From the 3rd century to the 16th century the dominant view held that the Earth was the rotational center of the universe.

Because he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by European thinkers during and after the Renaissance these thinkers often took Aristotle's erroneous positions as given which held back science in this epoch. However Aristotle's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields. For instance he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia. Moreover he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants.

===Geology===
As quoted from Charles Lyell's ''Principles of Geology'':
He Aristotle refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages. He instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized. He points to the growth of the Nilotic delta since the time of Homer to the shallowing of the Palus Maeotis within sixty years from his own time ... He alludes ... to the upheaving of one of the Eolian islands previous to a volcanic eruption. The changes of the earth he says are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives that they are overlooked; and the migrations of people after great catastrophes and their removal to other regions cause the event to be forgotten.

He says 12th chapter of his ''Meteorics'' 'the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land and again it becomes land where it was sea and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system and within a certain period.' The concluding observation is as follows: 'As time never fails and the universe is eternal neither the Tanais nor the Nile can have flowed for ever. The places where they rise were once dry and there is a limit to their operations but there is none to time. So also of all other rivers; they spring up and they perish; and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others The same tracts therefore of the earth are not some always sea and others always continents but every thing changes in the course of time.'

===Physics===


====Five elements====

Aristotle proposed a fifth element aether in addition to the four proposed earlier by Empedocles.
* Earth which is cold and dry; this corresponds to the modern idea of a solid.
* Water which is cold and wet; this corresponds to the modern idea of a liquid.
* Air which is hot and wet; this corresponds to the modern idea of a gas.
* Fire which is hot and dry; this corresponds to the modern ideas of plasma and heat.
* Aether which is the divine substance that makes up the heavenly spheres and heavenly bodies (stars and planets).

Each of the four earthly elements has its natural place. All that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe i.e. the center of the Earth. Water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center. Air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere. Fire tends toward the lunar sphere (in which the Moon orbits). When elements are moved out of their natural place they naturally move back towards it. This is ""natural motion"" – motion requiring no extrinsic cause. So for example in water earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up; in air rain falls and flame rises. Outside all the other spheres the heavenly fifth element manifested in the stars and planets moves in the perfection of circles.

====Motion====

Aristotle defined motion as the actuality of a potentiality ''as such''. Aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally; that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential as a transition toward a potentially possible state. Because actuality and potentiality are normally opposites in Aristotle other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous or that the addition of the ""as such"" to the definition is critical to understanding it.

====Causality the four causes==== 

Aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors.  His name ''aitia'' is traditionally translated as ""cause"" but it does not always refer to temporal sequence;  it might be better translated as ""explanation"" but the traditional rendering will be employed here.
* Material cause describes the material out of which something is composed. Thus the material cause of a table is wood and the material cause of a car is rubber and steel. It is not about action. It does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino.
* The formal cause is its form i.e. the arrangement of that matter. It tells us what a thing is that any thing is determined by the definition form pattern essence whole synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws as the whole (i.e. macrostructure) is the cause of its parts a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor and in the second place as intrinsic determining cause embodied in the matter. Formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation. A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist architect or engineer to create a drawing.
* The efficient cause is ""the primary source"" or that from which the change under consideration proceeds. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents nonliving or living acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect this covers the modern definitions of ""cause"" as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. So take the two dominoes this time of equal weighting the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over.
* The final cause (''telos'') is its purpose or that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve. This covers modern ideas of motivating causes such as volition need desire ethics or spiritual beliefs.

Additionally things can be causes of one another causing each other reciprocally as hard work causes fitness and vice versa although not in the same way or function the one is as the beginning of change the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect.) Moreover Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event. Our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino because it cannot fall of its own accord.

Aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes both proper and incidental can be spoken of as actual or potential and as generic or particular. The same language refers to the effects of causes so that actual effects are assigned to operating causes generic effects to generic causes and particular effects to particular causes.

====Optics====
Aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day. The second oldest written evidence of a camera obscura (after Mozi c. 400 BC) can be found in Aristotle's documentation of such a device in 350 BC in ''Problemata''. Aristotle's apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole or aperture to allow for sunlight to enter. Aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object. In modern cameras this is analogous to the diaphragm. Aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased the image was magnified.

====Chance and spontaneity====
According to Aristotle spontaneity and chance are causes of some things distinguishable from other types of cause. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things. It is ""from what is spontaneous"" (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of ""chance"" it might be better to think of ""coincidence"": Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place.

For example: A person seeks donations. That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. However if the person seeking the donations met the person donating not for the purpose of collecting donations but for some other purpose Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words if something happens all or most of the time we cannot say that it is by chance.

There is also more specific kind of chance which Aristotle names ""luck"" that can only apply to human beings because it is in the sphere of moral actions. According to Aristotle luck must involve choice (and thus deliberation) and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice. ""What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance"".

===Metaphysics===


Aristotle defines metaphysics as ""the knowledge of immaterial being"" or of ""being in the highest degree of abstraction."" He refers to metaphysics as ""first philosophy"" as well as ""the theologic science"".

====Substance potentiality and actuality====

Aristotle examines the concepts of substance and essence (''ousia'') in his ''Metaphysics'' (Book VII) and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form. In Book VIII he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum or the stuff of which it is composed. For example the matter of a house is the bricks stones timbers etc. or whatever constitutes the ''potential'' house while the form of the substance is the ''actual'' house namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other differentia (see also predicables) that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.

With regard to the change (''kinesis'') and its causes now as he defines in his ''Physics'' and ''On Generation and Corruption'' 319b–320a he distinguishes the coming to be from:
# growth and diminution which is change in quantity;
# locomotion which is change in space; and
# alteration which is change in quality.

The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (''dynamis'') and actuality (''entelecheia'') in association with the matter and the form.

Referring to potentiality this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (''dynamei'') plant and if is not prevented by something it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (''poiein'') or 'be acted upon' (''paschein'') which can be either innate or learned. For example the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate – being acted upon) while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise – acting).

Actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (''telos'') is the principle of every change and for the sake of the end exists potentiality therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.
For that for the sake of which a thing is is its principle and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight but they have sight that they may see.

In summary the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities which is also a final cause or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula in time and in substantiality.

With this definition of the particular substance (i.e. matter and form) Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings for example ""what is it that makes a man one""? Since according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped how then is man a unity? However according to Aristotle the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same thing.

====Universals and particulars====

Aristotle's predecessor Plato argued that all things have a universal form which could be either a property or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple for example we see an apple and we can also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover we can place an apple next to a book so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.

Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example it is possible that there is no particular good in existence but ""good"" is still a proper universal form. Bertrand Russell is a 20th-century philosopher who agreed with Plato on the existence of ""uninstantiated universals"".

Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point arguing that all universals are instantiated. Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. According to Aristotle if a universal exists either as a particular or a relation then there must have been must be currently or must be in the future something on which the universal can be predicated. Consequently according to Aristotle if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time then it does not exist.

In addition Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. As Plato spoke of the world of the forms a location where all universal forms subsist Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So according to Aristotle the form of apple exists within each apple rather than in the world of the forms.

===Biology and medicine===


In Aristotelian science especially in biology things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others which contain error and superstition. He dissected animals but not humans; his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded.

====Empirical research program====

''Torpedo fuscomaculata''
Leopard shark

Aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail. Aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of Lesbos and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas. The works that reflect this research the ''History of Animals'' ''Generation of Animals'' ''Movement of Animals'' and ''Parts of Animals'' contain some observations and interpretations along with sundry myths and mistakes. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. His observations on catfish electric fish (''Torpedo'') and angler-fish are detailed as is his writing on cephalopods namely ''Octopus'' ''Sepia'' (cuttlefish) and the paper nautilus (''Argonauta argo''). His description of the hectocotyl arm used in sexual reproduction was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selachē (selachians).

An example of his methods including dissection and observation comes from the ''Generation of Animals'' where he describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to discover the sequence in which visible organs are generated.

Aristotle gave accurate descriptions of the four-chambered fore-stomachs of ruminants and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark ''Mustelus mustelus''.

====Classification of living things====
Aristotle distinguished about 500 species of birds mammals and fishes. What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates Aristotle called 'animals with blood' and 'animals without blood'. Animals with blood were divided into live-bearing (mammals) and egg-bearing (birds and fish). Invertebrates ('animals without blood') are insects crustacea (divided into non-shelled – cephalopods – and shelled) and testacea (molluscs).

Aristotle believed that intellectual purposes i.e. final causes guided all natural processes. Such a teleological view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design. Noting that ""no animal has at the same time both tusks and horns"" and ""a single-hooved animal with two horns I have never seen"" Aristotle suggested that Nature giving no animal both horns and tusks was staving off vanity and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary. Noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter with Nature trying to preserve a type of balance.

He stated in the ''History of Animals'' that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from minerals to plants and animals and on up to man forming the ''scala naturae'' or great chain of being. His system had eleven grades arranged according ""to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality"" expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive the lowest bore theirs cold dry and in thick eggs. For Charles Singer ""Nothing is more remarkable than Aristotle's efforts to exhibit the relationships of living things as a ''scala naturae''"".

Aristotle also held that the level of a creature's perfection was reflected in its form but not preordained by that form. Ideas like this and his ideas about souls are not regarded as science at all in modern times.

He placed emphasis on the type(s) of soul an organism possessed asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul responsible for reproduction and growth animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul responsible for mobility and sensation and humans a vegetative a sensitive and a rational soul capable of thought and reflection.

Aristotle in contrast to earlier philosophers but in accordance with the Egyptians placed the rational soul in the heart rather than the brain. Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought which generally went against previous philosophers with the exception of Alcmaeon.

====Successor: Theophrastus====

frontispiece to a 1644 version of the expanded and illustrated edition of ''Historia Plantarum'' (ca. 1200) which was originally written around 300 BC.

Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum Theophrastus wrote a series of books on botany – the ''History of Plants'' – which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany even into the Middle Ages. Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times such as ''carpos'' for fruit and ''pericarpion'' for seed vessel.

Rather than focus on formal causes as Aristotle did Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes and relying on Aristotle's concept of the efficient cause. Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants though this last discovery was lost in later ages.

====Influence on Hellenistic medicine====

After Theophrastus the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived they were generally taken unquestioningly. It is not until the age of Alexandria under the Ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found.

The first medical teacher at Alexandria Herophilus of Chalcedon corrected Aristotle placing intelligence in the brain and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries noting that the latter pulse while the former do not. Though a few ancient atomists such as Lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life teleology (and after the rise of Christianity natural theology) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. Ernst Mayr claimed that there was ""nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance."" Aristotle's ideas of natural history and medicine survived but they were generally taken unquestioningly.

===Psychology===
Aristotle's psychology given in his treatise ''On the Soul'' (''peri psyche'' often known by its Latin title ''De Anima'') posits three kinds of soul (""psyches""): the vegetative soul the sensitive soul and the rational soul. Humans have a rational soul. This kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. The unique part of the human rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them.

For Aristotle the soul (''psyche'') was a simpler concept than it is for us today. By soul he simply meant the form of a living being. Because all beings are composites of form and matter the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants growth and chemical transformations which Aristotle considers types of movement).

====Memory====

According to Aristotle memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in your mind and to have the ability to distinguish between the internal ""appearance"" and an occurrence in the past. In other words a memory is a mental picture (phantasm) in which Aristotle defines in ''De Anima'' as an appearance which is imprinted on the part of the body that forms a memory. Aristotle believed an ""imprint"" becomes impressed on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. A memory occurs when a stimuli is too complex that the nervous system (semi-fluid bodily organ) cannot receive all the impressions at once. These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation common sense and thinking . The mental picture imprinted on the bodily organ is the final product of the entire process of sense perception. It does not matter if the experience was seen or heard every experience ends up as a mental image in memory


Aristotle uses the word ""memory"" for two basic abilities. First the actual retaining of the experience in the mnemonic ""imprint"" that can develop from sensation. Second the intellectual anxiety that comes with the ""imprint"" due to being impressed at a particular time and processing specific contents. These abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time. Therefore memory is of the past  prediction is of the future and sensation is of the present. The retrieval of our ""imprints"" cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences both for our previous experience and present experience.

Aristotle proposed that slow-witted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the ""imprint"" can easily continue. However they cannot be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new ""imprints"". He believed the young and the old do not properly develop an ""imprint"". Young people undergo rapid changes as they develop while the elderly's organs are beginning to decay thus stunting new ""imprints"". Likewise people who are too quick-witted are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ. Because intellectual functions are not involved in memory memories belong to some animals too but only those in which have perception of time.

=====Recollection=====
Because Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or ""imprints"" people are continually weaving together new ""imprints"" of things they experience. In order to search for these ""imprints"" people search the memory itself. Within the memory if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. Recollection occurs when one experience naturally follows another. If the chain of ""images"" is needed one memory will stimulate the other. If the chain of ""images"" is not needed but expected then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances. When people recall experiences they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated the one that was needed.

Recollection is the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory ""imprint"" after some time has passed. Retrieval of stored information is dependent on the scope of mnemonic capabilities of a being (human or animal) and the abilities the human or animal possesses. Only humans will remember ""imprints"" of intellectual activity such as numbers and words. Animals that have perception of time will be able to retrieve memories of their past observations. Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed. Recollection of an ""imprint"" is when the present experiences a person remembers are similar with elements corresponding in character and arrangement of past sensory experiences. When an ""imprint"" is recalled it may bring forth a large group of related ""imprints"".

Aristotle believed the chain of thought which ends in recollection of certain ""imprints"" was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships: similarity contrast and contiguity. These three laws make up his Laws of Association. Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle association is the power innate in a mental state which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences allowing them to rise and be recalled.

====Dreams====

=====Sleep=====
Before understanding Aristotle's views on dreams first his idea of sleep must be examined. Aristotle gives an account of his explanation of sleep in ''On Sleep and Wakefulness''. Sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses or of digestion so it is vital to the body including the senses so it can be revitalized. While a person is asleep the critical activities which include thinking sensing recalling and remembering do not function as they do during wakefulness. Since a person cannot sense during sleep they can also not have a desire which is the result of a sensation. However the senses are able to work during sleep albeit differently than when a person is awake because during sleep a person can still have sensory experiences. Also not all of the senses are inactive during sleep only the ones that are weary.

=====Theory of dreams=====
Dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus because as discussed the senses do not work as they normally do during sleep. In dreams sensation is still involved but in an altered manner than when awake. Aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water. When they look away from that stimulus the next thing they look at appears to be moving in a wave like motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention it leaves an impression. When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant. However during sleep the impressions stimuli made throughout the day become noticed because there are not new sensory experiences to distract from these impressions that were made. So dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli dreams will not resemble the actual experience that occurred when awake.

During sleep a person is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. When a person is asleep their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like a person who is influenced by strong feelings. Since a person sleeping is in this suggestible state they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams.

When asleep a person is unable to make judgments as they do when they are awake Due to the senses not functioning normally during sleep they are unable to help a person judge what is happening in their dream. This in turn leads the person to believe the dream is real. Dreams may be absurd in nature but the senses are not able to discern whether they are real or not. So the dreamer is left to accept the dream because they lack the choice to judge it.

One component of Aristotle's theory of dreams introduces ideas that are contradictory to previously held beliefs. He claimed that dreams are not foretelling and that they are not sent by a divine being. Aristotle reasoned that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are happenstances not divinations. These ideas were contradictory to what had been believed about dreams but at the time in which he introduced these ideas more thinkers were beginning to give naturalistic as opposed to supernatural explanations to phenomena.

Aristotle also includes in his theory of dreams what constitutes a dream and what does not. He claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it. If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred. Secondly any sensory experience that actually occurs while a person is asleep and is perceived by the person while asleep does not qualify as part of a dream. For example if while a person is sleeping a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut Aristotle argues that this sensory experience is not part of the dream. The actual sensory experience is perceived by the senses the fact that it occurred while the person was asleep does not make it part of the dream. Lastly the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of sensory experiences had when awake.

===Practical philosophy===

====Ethics====

Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study i.e. one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics including most notably the ''Nicomachean Ethics''.

Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (''ergon'') of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans and that this function must be an activity of the ''psuchē'' (normally translated as ''soul'') in accordance with reason (''logos''). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action ''eudaimonia'' generally translated as ""happiness"" or sometimes ""well being"". To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (''ēthikē'' ''aretē'') often translated as moral (or ethical) virtue (or excellence).

Aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately but by teachers and experience leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (''phronesis'') and their intellect (''nous'') can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker or in other words a philosopher.

====Politics====

Aristotle's classification of constitutions

In addition to his works on ethics which address the individual Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled ''Politics''. Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual ""for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part"". He also famously stated that ""man is by nature a political animal"" and also arguing that humanity's defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality. Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.

The common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle's understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (''polis'') which functions as a political ""community"" or ""partnership"" (''koinōnia''). The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life and to perform beautiful acts: ""The political partnership must be regarded therefore as being for the sake of noble actions not for the sake of living together."" This is distinguished from modern approaches beginning with social contract theory according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of ""fear of violent death"" or its ""inconveniences.""

Excerpt from a speech by the character 'Aristotle' in the book Protrepticus (Hutchinson and Johnson 2015 p. 22)
:''For we all agree that the most excellent man should rule i.e. the supreme by nature and that the law rules and alone is authoritative; but the law is a kind of intelligence i.e. a discourse based on intelligence. And again what standard do we have what criterion of good things that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose if the choice is based on his knowledge are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly a man with bravery to live bravely likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control) it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. Hence it's evident that according to the most authoritative judgment intelligence is supreme among goods.''

====Rhetoric and poetics====

Aristotle considered epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry and music to be imitative each varying in imitation by medium object and manner. For example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy for instance is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama. Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.

While it is believed that Aristotle's ''Poetics'' comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure character style thought spectacle and lyric poetry. The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot not the characters is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes ''Poetics'' with a discussion on which if either is superior: epic or tragic mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music is more unified and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope it can be considered superior to epic.

Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles folklore and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the Delphic Oracle and studied the fables of Aesop.

===Views on women===

Aristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert passive female element. On this ground feminist metaphysics have accused Aristotle of misogyny and sexism. However Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's and commented in his ''Rhetoric'' that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men.

In Australia ''Ally McBeal'' was aired by the Seven Network from 1997 to 2002. In 2010 it was aired repeatedly by Network Ten.

===Crossovers with ''The Practice''===

Seymore Walsh a stern judge often exasperated by the eccentricities of the Cage & Fish lawyers and played by actor Albert Hall was also a recurring character on ''The Practice''. In addition Judge Jennifer (Whipper) Cone appears on ''The Practice'' episode ""Line of Duty"" (S02 E15) while Judge Roberta Kittelson a recurring character on ''The Practice'' has a featured guest role in the ''Ally McBeal'' episode ""Do you Wanna Dance?""

Most of the primary ''Practice'' cast members guest starred in the ''Ally McBeal'' episode ""The Inmates"" (S01 E20) in a storyline that concluded with the ''Practice'' episode ""Axe Murderer"" (S02 E26) featuring Calista Flockhart and Gil Bellows reprising their ''Ally'' characters. What's unusual about this continuing storyline is that ''Ally McBeal'' and ''The Practice'' aired on different networks.  Bobby Donnell the main character of ''The Practice'' played by Dylan McDermott was featured heavily in both this crossover and another ''Ally McBeal'' episode ""These are the Days"".

Regular ''Practice'' cast members Lara Flynn Boyle and Michael Badalucco each had a cameo in ''Ally McBeal'' (Boyle as a woman who trades insults with Ally in the episode ""Making Spirits Bright"" and Badalucco as one of Ally's dates in the episode ""I Know him by Heart"") but it is unclear whether they were playing the same characters they play on ''The Practice''.

===Governors of the State of Alabama===
Governor-Elect
Governor's Flag 1868–1939

Alabama was admitted to the Union on December 14 1819. It seceded from the Union on January 11 1861 and was a founding member of the Confederate States of America on February 4 1861; there was no Union Alabama government in exile so there was a single line of governors. Following the end of the American Civil War Alabama during Reconstruction was part of the Third Military District which exerted some control over governor appointments and elections. Alabama was readmitted to the Union on July 14 1868.

The first Alabama Constitution ratified in 1819 provided that a governor be elected every two years limited to serve no more than four out of every six years. This limit remained in place until the constitution of 1868 which simply allowed governors to serve terms of two years. The current constitution of 1901 increased terms to four years but prohibited governors from succeeding themselves. Amendment 282 to the constitution passed in 1968 allowed governors to succeed themselves once; a governor serves two consecutive terms can run again after waiting out the next term. The constitution had no set date for the commencement of a governor's term until 1901 when it was set at the first Monday after the second Tuesday in the January following an election.

The office of lieutenant governor was created in 1868 abolished in 1875 and recreated in 1901. According to the current constitution should the governor be out of the state for more than 20 days the lieutenant governor becomes acting governor and if the office of governor becomes vacant the lieutenant governor ascends to the governorship. Earlier constitutions said the powers of the governor devolved upon the successor rather than them necessarily becoming governor but the official listing includes these as full governors. The governor and lieutenant governor are not elected on the same ticket.

Alabama was a strongly Democratic state before the Civil War electing only candidates from the Democratic-Republican and Democratic parties. It had two Republican governors following Reconstruction but after the Democratic Party re-established control 112 years passed before voters chose another Republican.

103,Ampere,Everyday examples,"
The current drawn by typical constant-voltage energy distribution systems is usually dictated by the power (watt) consumed by the system and the operating voltage. For this reason the examples given below are grouped by voltage level.

=== Portable devices ===
*Hearing aid (typically 1 mW at 1.4 V): 700 µA
*USB charging adapter (as power supply - typically 10 W at 5 V): 2 A

=== Internal combustion engine vehicles – 12 V DC ===
A typical motor vehicle has a 12 V battery. The various accessories that are powered by the battery might include:
*Instrument panel light (typically 2 W): 166 mA
*Headlight (each typically 60 W): 5 A
*Starter motor (typically 1–2 kW): 80–160 A

=== North American domestic supply – 120 V AC ===
Most Canada Mexico and United States domestic power suppliers run at 120 V.

Household circuit breakers typically provide a maximum of 15 A or 20 A of current to a given set of outlets.
*22-inch/56-centimeter portable television (35 W): 290 mA
*Tungsten light bulb (60–100 W): 500–830 mA
*Toaster kettle (1.5 kW): 12.5 A
*Hair dryer (1.8 kW): 15 A
*USB charging adapter (as load - typically 10 W): 83 mA

=== European & Commonwealth domestic supply – 230–240 V AC ===
Most European domestic power supplies run at 230 V and most Commonwealth domestic power supplies run at 240 V. For the same amount of power (in watts) the current drawn by a particular European or Commonwealth appliance (in Europe or a Commonwealth country) will be less than for an equivalent North American appliance. Typical circuit breakers will provide 16 A.

The current drawn by a number of typical appliances are:
*22-inch/56-centimeter portable television (35 W): 145–150 mA
*Tungsten light bulb (60–100 W): 240–450 mA
*Compact fluorescent lamp (11–30 W): 56–112 mA
*Toaster kettle (2 kW): 9 A
*Immersion heater (4.6 kW): 19–20 A

371,AK-47,Design,"The AK-47 was designed to be a simple reliable automatic rifle that could be manufactured quickly and cheaply using mass production methods that were state of the art in the Soviet Union during the late 1940s. The AK-47 uses a long stroke gas system that is generally associated with great reliability in adverse conditions. The large gas piston generous clearances between moving parts and tapered cartridge case design allow the gun to endure large amounts of foreign matter and fouling without failing to cycle.

=== Cartridge ===

Wound Profiles of Russian small-arms ammunition compiled by Dr. Martin Fackler on behalf of the U.S. military

The AK fires the 7.62×39mm cartridge with a muzzle velocity of .
The cartridge weight is  the projectile weight is . The original Soviet M43 bullets are 123 grain boat-tail bullets with a copper-plated steel jacket a large steel core and some lead between the core and the jacket. The AK has excellent penetration when shooting through heavy foliage walls or a common vehicle's metal body and into an opponent attempting to use these things as cover. The 7.62×39mm M43 projectile does not generally fragment when striking an opponent and has an unusual tendency to remain intact even after making contact with bone. The 7.62×39mm round produces significant wounding in cases where the bullet tumbles (yaws) in tissue but produces relatively minor wounds in cases where the bullet exits before beginning to yaw. In the absence of yaw the M43 round can pencil through tissue with relatively little injury.

Most if not all of the 7.62×39mm ammunition found today is of the upgraded M67 variety. This variety deleted the steel insert shifting the center of gravity rearward and allowing the projectile to destabilize (or yaw) at about  nearly  earlier in tissue than the M43 round. This change also reduces penetration in ballistic gelatin to ~ for the newer M67 round versus ~ for the older M43 round. However the wounding potential of M67 is mostly limited to the small permanent wound channel the bullet itself makes especially when the bullet yaws.

=== Operating mechanism ===
Chinese AK-47

To fire the operator inserts a loaded magazine pulls back and releases the charging handle and then pulls the trigger. In semi-automatic the firearm fires only once requiring the trigger to be released and depressed again for the next shot. In full-automatic the rifle continues to fire automatically cycling fresh rounds into the chamber until the magazine is exhausted or pressure is released from the trigger. After ignition of the cartridge primer and propellant rapidly expanding propellant gases are diverted into the gas cylinder above the barrel through a vent near the muzzle. The build-up of gases inside the gas cylinder drives the long-stroke piston and bolt carrier rearward and a cam guide machined into the underside of the bolt carrier along with an ejector spur on the bolt carrier rail guide rotates the bolt approximately 35° and unlocks it from the barrel extension via a camming pin on the bolt. The moving assembly has about  of free travel which creates a delay between the initial recoil impulse of the piston and the bolt unlocking sequence allowing gas pressures to drop to a safe level before the seal between the chamber and the bolt is broken. The AK-47 does not have a gas valve; excess gases are ventilated through a series of radial ports in the gas cylinder. The Kalashnikov operating system offers no primary extraction upon bolt rotation but uses an extractor claw to eject the spent cartridge case.

=== Barrel ===
AK-47 barrel and its distinctive gas block with a horizontal row of gas relief ports

The rifle received a barrel with a chrome-lined bore and four right-hand grooves at a 240 mm (1 in 9.45 in) rifling twist rate. The gas block contains a gas channel that is installed at a slanted angle in relation to the bore axis. The muzzle is threaded for the installation of various muzzle devices such as a muzzle brake or a blank-firing adaptor.

===Gas block===
The gas block of the AK-47 features a cleaning rod capture or sling loop. Gas relief ports that alleviate gas pressure are placed horizontally in a row on the gas cylinder.

=== Fire selector ===
Việt Cộng soldier armed with an AK-47 standing beneath the flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam

The fire selector is a large lever located on the right side of the rifle it acts as a dust-cover and prevents the charging handle from being pulled fully to the rear when it is on safe. It is operated by the shooter's right fore-fingers and has 3 settings: safe (up) full-auto (center) and semi-auto (down). The reason for this is that under stress a soldier will push the selector lever down with considerable force bypassing the full-auto stage and setting the rifle to semi-auto. To set the AK-47 to full-auto requires the deliberate action of centering the selector lever. To operate the fire selector lever right handed shooters have to briefly remove their right hand from the pistol grip which is ergonomically sub-optimal. Some AK-type rifles also have a more traditional selector lever on the left side of the receiver just above the pistol grip. This lever is operated by the shooter's right thumb and has three settings: safe (forward) full-auto (center) and semi-auto (backward).

=== Sights ===
Rear sight of a Chinese Type 56 featuring  settings and omission of a battle zero setting

The AK-47 uses a notched rear tangent iron sight calibrated in  increments from . The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation in the field. Horizontal adjustment requires a special drift tool and is done by the armory before issue or if the need arises by an armorer after issue. The sight line elements are approximately  over the bore axis. The ""point-blank range"" battle zero setting ""''П''"" on the 7.62×39mm AK-47 rear tangent sight element corresponds to a  zero. These settings mirror the Mosin–Nagant and SKS rifles which the AK-47 replaced. For the AK-47 combined with service cartridges the 300 m battle zero setting limits the apparent ""bullet rise"" within approximately  relative to the line of sight. Soldiers are instructed to fire at any target within this range by simply placing the sights on the center of mass (the belt buckle according to Russian and former Soviet doctrine) of the enemy target. Any errors in range estimation are tactically irrelevant as a well-aimed shot will hit the torso of the enemy soldier. Some AK-type rifles have a front sight with a flip-up luminous dot that is calibrated at  for improved night fighting.

=== Furniture ===
The AK-47 was originally equipped with a buttstock handguard and an upper heat guard made from solid wood. With the introduction of the Type 3 receiver the buttstock lower handguard and upper heatguard were manufactured from birch plywood laminates. Such engineered woods are stronger and resist warping better than the conventional one-piece patterns do not require lengthy maturing and are cheaper. The wooden furniture was finished with the Russian amber shellac finishing process. AKS and AKMS models featured a downward-folding metal butt-stock similar to that of the German MP40 submachine-gun for use in the restricted space in the BMP infantry combat vehicle as well as by paratroops. All 100 series AKs use plastic furniture with side-folding stocks.

=== Magazines ===
AK-47 with stamp-steel magazines
""Bakelite"" rust-colored steel-reinforced 30-round plastic box 7.62×39mm AK magazines. Three magazines have an ""arrow in triangle"" Izhmash arsenal mark on the bottom right. The other magazine has a ""star"" Tula arsenal mark on the bottom right

The standard magazine capacity is 30 rounds. There are also 10 20 and 40-round box magazines as well as 75-round drum magazines.

The AK-47's standard 30-round magazines have a pronounced curve that allows them to smoothly feed ammunition into the chamber. Their heavy steel construction combined with ""feed-lips"" (the surfaces at the top of the magazine that control the angle at which the cartridge enters the chamber) machined from a single steel billet makes them highly resistant to damage. These magazines are so strong that ""Soldiers have been known to use their mags as hammers and even bottle openers"". This contributes to the AK-47 magazine being more reliable but makes it heavier than U.S. and NATO magazines.

The early slab-sided steel AK-47 30-round detachable box magazines had  sheet-metal bodies and weigh  empty. The later steel AKM 30-round magazines had lighter sheet-metal bodies with prominent reinforcing ribs weighing  empty. To further reduce weight a light weight magazine with an aluminum body with a prominent reinforcing waffle rib pattern weighing  empty was developed for the AKM that proved to be too fragile and the small issued amount of these magazines were quickly withdrawn from service. As a replacement steel-reinforced 30-round plastic 7.62×39mm box magazines were introduced. These rust-colored magazines weigh  empty and are often mistakenly identified as being made of Bakelite (a phenolic resin) but were actually fabricated from two-parts of AG-S4 molding compound (a glass-reinforced phenol-formaldehyde binder impregnated composite) assembled using an epoxy resin adhesive. Noted for their durability these magazines did however compromise the rifle's camouflage and lacked the small horizontal reinforcing ribs running down both sides of the magazine body near the front that were added on all later plastic magazine generations. A second generation steel-reinforced dark-brown (color shades vary from maroon to plum to near black) 30-round 7.62×39mm magazine was introduced in the early 1980s fabricated from ABS plastic. The third generation steel-reinforced 30-round 7.62×39mm magazine is similar to the second generation but is darker colored and has a matte nonreflective surface finish. The current issue steel-reinforced matte true black nonreflective surface finished 7.62×39mm 30-round magazines fabricated from ABS plastic weigh  empty.

Early steel AK-47 magazines are  long; the later ribbed steel AKM and newer plastic 7.62×39mm magazines are about  shorter.

The transition from steel to mainly plastic magazines yields a significant weight reduction and allows a soldier to carry more ammunition for the same weight.

Most Yugoslavian and some East German AK magazines were made with cartridge followers that hold the bolt open when empty; however most AK magazine followers allow the bolt to close when the magazine is empty.

=== Accessories ===
AK-47 6H2 bayonet and scabbard
GP-34 Grenade Launcher
AK-47 with Kalashnikov grenade launcher mounted on the muzzle
Accessories supplied with the rifle include a  long 6H3 bayonet featuring a  long spear point blade. The AK-47 bayonet is installed by slipping the  diameter muzzle ring around the muzzle and latching the handle down on the bayonet lug under the front sight base.

All current model AKM rifles can mount under-barrel 40 mm grenade launchers such as the GP-25 and its variants which can fire up to 20 rounds per minute and have an effective range of up to 400 metres. The main grenade is the VOG-25 (VOG-25M) fragmentation grenade which has a 6 m (9 m) (20 ft (30 ft)) lethality radius. The VOG-25P/VOG-25PM (""jumping"") variant explodes  above the ground.

The AK-47 can also mount a (rarely used) cup-type grenade launcher the Kalashnikov grenade launcher that fires standard RGD-5 Soviet hand-grenades. The maximum effective range is approximately 150 meters. This launcher can also be used to launch tear-gas and riot control grenades.

All current AKs (100 series) and some older models have side rails for mounting a variety of scopes and sighting devices such as the PSO-1 Optical Sniper Sight. The side rails allow for the removal and remounting of optical accessories without interfering with the zeroing of the optic. However the 100 series side folding stocks cannot be folded with the optics mounted.

144,Andy Warhol,Foundation,"
Warhol's will dictated that his entire estate—with the exception of a few modest legacies to family members—would go to create a foundation dedicated to the ""advancement of the visual arts"". Warhol had so many possessions that it took Sotheby's nine days to auction his estate after his death; the auction grossed more than US$20 million.

In 1987 in accordance with Warhol's will the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts began. The foundation serves as the estate of Andy Warhol but also has a mission ""to foster innovative artistic expression and the creative process"" and is ""focused primarily on supporting work of a challenging and often experimental nature.""

The Artists Rights Society is the U.S. copyright representative for the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts for all Warhol works with the exception of Warhol film stills. The U.S. copyright representative for Warhol film stills is the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. Additionally the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts has agreements in place for its image archive. All digital images of Warhol are exclusively managed by Corbis while all transparency images of Warhol are managed by Art Resource.

The Andy Warhol Foundation released its ''20th Anniversary Annual Report'' as a three-volume set in 2007: Vol. I 1987–2007; Vol. II Grants & Exhibitions; and Vol. III Legacy Program. The Foundation remains one of the largest grant-giving organizations for the visual arts in the U.S.

Many of Warhol's works and possessions are on display at The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.  The foundation donated more than 3000 works of art to the museum.

648,Adenosine triphosphate,Functions in cells,"
===Metabolism synthesis and active transport===
ATP is consumed in the cell by energy-requiring (endergonic) processes and can be generated by energy-releasing (exergonic) processes. In this way ATP transfers energy between spatially separate metabolic reactions. ATP is the main energy source for the majority of cellular functions. This includes the synthesis of macromolecules including DNA and RNA (see below) and proteins. ATP also plays a critical role in the transport of macromolecules across cell membranes e.g. exocytosis and endocytosis.

===Roles in cell structure and locomotion===
ATP is critically involved in maintaining cell structure by facilitating assembly and disassembly of elements of the cytoskeleton. In a related process ATP is required for the shortening of actin and myosin filament crossbridges required for muscle contraction. This latter process is one of the main energy requirements of animals and is essential for locomotion and respiration.

===Cell signalling===


====Extracellular signalling====

Extracellular ATP (eATP) is also a signalling molecule. ATP ADP or adenosine are recognised by purinergic receptors or purinoreceptors which might be the most abundant receptors in mammalian tissues.

In humans this signalling role is important in both the central and peripheral nervous system. Activity-dependent release of ATP from synapses axons and glia activates purinergic membrane receptors known as P2. The ''P2Y'' receptors are G protein-coupled receptors which are ''metabotropic'' and primarily modulate intracellular calcium and to a lesser extent cyclic AMP levels. Though named between P2Y1 and P2Y15 only nine members of the P2Y family have been cloned and some are only related through weak homology and several (P2Y5 P2Y7 P2Y9 P2Y10) do not function as receptors that raise cytosolic calcium. The ''P2X ionotropic'' receptor subgroup comprises seven members (P2X1–P2X7) which are ligand-gated -permeable ion channels that open when bound to an extracellular purine nucleotide like ATP. In contrast to P2 receptors (agonist rank order of potency:  >  >  > ) purinergic nucleoside triphosphates like ATP are not strong agonists of P1 receptors which are strongly activated by adenosine and other nucleosides (ADO > AMP > ADP > ATP). P1 receptors have A1 A2a A2b and A3 subtypes (the ""A"" is standard nomenclature for indicating an ''adenosine receptor'' subtype) all of which are G protein-coupled receptors A1 and A3 being coupled to Gi and A2a and A2b being coupled to Gs.

All adenosine receptors were shown to activate at least one subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases. The actions of adenosine are often antagonistic or synergistic to the actions of ATP. In the CNS adenosine has multiple functions such as modulation of neural development neuron and glial signalling and the control of innate and adaptive immune systems.

====Intracellular signaling====
ATP is critical in signal transduction processes. It is used by kinases as the source of phosphate groups in their phosphate transfer reactions. Kinase activity on substrates such as proteins or membrane lipids are a common form of signal transduction. Phosphorylation of a protein by a kinase can activate a cascade such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.

ATP is also used by adenylate cyclase most commonly in G protein-coupled receptor signal transduction pathways and is transformed to the second messenger molecule cyclic AMP which is involved in triggering calcium signals by the release of calcium from intracellular stores. This form of signal transduction is particularly important in brain function although it is involved in the regulation of a multitude of other cellular processes.

===DNA and RNA synthesis===
In all known organisms the Deoxyribonucleotides that make up DNA are synthesized by the action of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) enzymes on their corresponding ribonucleotides. These enzymes reduce the sugar residue from ribose to deoxyribose by removing oxygen from the 2′ hydroxyl group; the substrates are ribonucleoside diphosphates and the products deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates (the latter are denoted dADP dCDP dGDP and dUDP respectively.) All ribonucleotide reductase enzymes use a common sulfhydryl radical mechanism reliant on reactive cysteine residues that oxidize to form disulfide bonds in the course of the reaction. RNR enzymes are recycled by reaction with thioredoxin or glutaredoxin.

The regulation of RNR and related enzymes maintains a balance of dNTPs relative to each other and relative to NTPs in the cell. Very low dNTP concentration inhibits DNA synthesis and DNA repair and is lethal to the cell while an abnormal ratio of dNTPs is mutagenic due to the increased likelihood of the DNA polymerase incorporating the wrong dNTP during DNA synthesis. Regulation of or differential specificity of RNR has been proposed as a mechanism for alterations in the relative sizes of intracellular dNTP pools under cellular stress such as hypoxia.

In the synthesis of the nucleic acid RNA adenosine derived from ATP is one of the four nucleotides incorporated directly into RNA molecules by RNA polymerases. The energy driving this polymerization comes from cleaving off a pyrophosphate (two phosphate groups). The process is similar in DNA biosynthesis except that ATP is reduced to the deoxyribonucleotide dATP before incorporation into DNA.

===Boston (1871–1952)===


====1871–1913====
1873 Boston Red Stockings team picture; it finished first with a record of 43–16

The Cincinnati Red Stockings established in 1869 as the first openly all-professional baseball team voted to dissolve after the 1870 season. Player-manager Harry Wright with brother George and two other Cincinnati players then went to Boston Massachusetts at the invitation of Boston Red Stockings founder Ivers Whitney Adams to form the nucleus of the ''Boston Red Stockings'' a charter member of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP). The original Boston Red Stockings team and its successors can lay claim to being the oldest continuously playing team in American professional sports. (The only other team that has been organized as long the Chicago Cubs did not play for the two years following the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.) Two young players hired away from the Forest City club of Rockford Illinois turned out to be the biggest stars during the NAPBBP years: pitcher Al Spalding (founder of Spalding sporting goods) and second baseman Ross Barnes.

Led by the Wright brothers Barnes and Spalding the Red Stockings dominated the National Association winning four of that league's five championships. The team became one of the National League's charter franchises in 1876 sometimes called the ""''Red Caps''"" (as a new Cincinnati Red Stockings club was another charter member). 

The Boston Red Caps played in the first game in the history of the National League on Saturday April 22 1876 defeating the Athletics 6-5.

1888 Boston Beaneaters
Although somewhat stripped of talent in the National League's inaugural year Boston bounced back to win the 1877 and 1878 pennants. The Red Caps/Beaneaters were one of the league's dominant teams during the 19th century winning a total of eight pennants. For most of that time their manager was Frank Selee. Boston came to be called the ''Beaneaters'' in 1883 while retaining red as the team color. The 1898 team finished 102–47 a club record for wins that would stand for almost a century. Stars of those 1890s Beaneater teams included the ""Heavenly Twins"" Hugh Duffy and Tommy McCarthy as well as ""Slidin'"" Billy Hamilton.

Hugh Duffy played with the franchise from 1892 to 1900 and won the third Triple Crown in MLB history
The team was decimated when the American League's new Boston entry set up shop in 1901. Many of the Beaneaters' stars jumped to the new team which offered contracts that the Beaneaters' owners did not even bother to match. They only managed one winning season from 1900 to 1913 and lost 100 games five times. In 1907 the Beaneaters (temporarily) eliminated the last bit of red from their stockings because their manager thought the red dye could cause wounds to become infected (as noted in ''The Sporting News Baseball Guide'' during the 1940s when each team's entry had a history of its nickname(s). The American League club's owner Charles Taylor wasted little time in adopting Red Sox as his team's first official nickname (up to that point they had been called by the generic ""Americans""). Media-driven nickname changes to the ''Doves'' in 1907 and the ''Rustlers'' in 1911 did nothing to change the National League club's luck. The team became the ''Braves'' for the first time in 1912. Their owner James Gaffney was a member of New York City's political machine Tammany Hall which used an Indian chief as their symbol.

====1914: Miracle====


Two years later the Braves put together one of the most memorable seasons in baseball history. After a dismal 4–18 start the Braves seemed to be on pace for a last place finish. On July 4 1914 the Braves lost both games of a doubleheader to the Brooklyn Dodgers. The consecutive losses put their record at 26–40 and the Braves were in last place ''15 games'' behind the league-leading New York Giants who had won the previous three league pennants. After a day off the Braves started to put together a hot streak and from July 6 through September 5 the Braves went 41–12. On September 7 and 8 the Braves took two of three games from the New York Giants and moved into first place. The Braves tore through September and early October closing with 25 wins against six losses while the Giants went 16–16. They were the only team under the old eight-team league format to win a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July. They were in last place as late as July 18 but were close to the pack moving into fourth on July 21 and second place on August 12.

Bill James was 2–0 in the 1914 World Series and the Braves recorded the first sweep in World Series history
Despite their amazing comeback the Braves entered the World Series as a heavy underdog to Connie Mack's Philadelphia A's. Nevertheless the Braves swept the Athletics—the first unqualified sweep in the young history of the modern World Series (the 1907 Series had one tied game) to win the world championship. Meanwhile Johnny Evers won the Chalmers Award.

The Braves played the World Series (as well as the last few games of the 1914 season) at Fenway Park since their normal home the South End Grounds was too small. However the Braves' success inspired owner Gaffney to build a modern park Braves Field which opened in August 1915. It was the largest park in the majors at the time with 40000 seats and a very spacious outfield. The park was novel for its time; public transportation brought fans right to the park.

====1915–1953====
After contending for most of 1915 and 1916 the Braves only twice posted winning records from 1917 to 1932. The lone highlight of those years came when Judge Emil Fuchs bought the team in 1923 to bring his longtime friend pitching great Christy Mathewson back into the game. However Mathewson died in 1925 leaving Fuchs in control of the team.

Fuchs was committed to building a winner but the damage from the years prior to his arrival took some time to overcome. The Braves finally managed to be competitive in 1933 and 1934 under manager Bill McKechnie but Fuchs' revenue was severely depleted due to the Great Depression.

Looking for a way to get more fans and more money Fuchs worked out a deal with the New York Yankees to acquire Babe Ruth who had started his career with the Red Sox. Fuchs made Ruth team vice president and promised him a share of the profits. He was also granted the title of assistant manager and was to be consulted on all of the Braves' deals. Fuchs even suggested that Ruth who had long had his heart set on managing could take over as manager once McKechnie stepped down—perhaps as early as 1936.

At first it appeared that Ruth was the final piece the team needed in 1935. On opening day he had a hand in all of the Braves' runs in a 4–2 win over the Giants. However that proved to be the only time the Braves were over .500 all year. Events went downhill quickly. While Ruth could still hit he could do little else. He could not run and his fielding was so terrible that three of the Braves' pitchers threatened to go on strike if Ruth were in the lineup. It soon became obvious that he was vice president and assistant manager in name only and Fuchs' promise of a share of team profits was hot air. In fact Ruth discovered that Fuchs expected him to invest some of ''his'' money in the team.

Seeing a franchise in complete disarray Ruth retired on June 1—only six days after he clouted what turned out to be the last three home runs of his career. He had wanted to quit as early as May 12 but Fuchs wanted him to hang on so he could play in every National League park. The Braves finished 38–115 the worst season in franchise history. Their .248 winning percentage is the third-worst in baseball history and the second-worst in National League history (behind only the 1899 Cleveland Spiders).

Fuchs lost control of the team in August 1935 and the new owners tried to change the team's image by renaming it the ''Boston Bees''. This did little to change the team's fortunes. After five uneven years a new owner construction magnate Lou Perini changed the nickname back to the Braves. He immediately set about rebuilding the team. World War II slowed things down a little but the team rode the pitching of Warren Spahn to impressive seasons in 1946 and 1947.

Spahn (right) with Johnny Sain
In 1948 the team won the pennant behind the pitching of Spahn and Johnny Sain who won 39 games between them. The remainder of the rotation was so thin that in September ''Boston Post'' writer Gerald Hern wrote this poem about the pair:

:''First we'll use Spahn''
:''then we'll use Sain''
:''Then an off day''
:''followed by rain''
:''Back will come Spahn''
:''followed by Sain''
:''And followed''
:''we hope''
:''by two days of rain.''

The poem received such a wide audience that the sentiment usually now paraphrased as ''""Spahn and Sain and pray for rain""'' entered the baseball vocabulary. However in the 1948 season the Braves actually had the same record in games that Spahn and Sain started that the team had overall in terms of winning percentage.

The 1948 World Series which the Braves lost in six games to the Indians turned out to be the Braves' last hurrah in Boston. In 1950 Sam Jethroe became the team's first African American player making his major league debut on April 18. Amid four mediocre seasons attendance steadily dwindled until on March 13 1953 Perini who had recently bought out his original partners announced he was moving the team to Milwaukee where the Braves had their top farm club the Brewers. Milwaukee had long been a possible target for relocation. Bill Veeck had tried to return his St. Louis Browns there earlier the same year (Milwaukee was the original home of that franchise) but his proposal had been voted down by the other American League owners.

===Milwaukee (1953–1965)===


Milwaukee went wild over the Braves who were welcomed as genuine heroes. The Braves finished 92–62 in their first season in Milwaukee and drew a then-NL record 1.8 million fans. The success of the team was noted by many owners. Not coincidentally the Philadelphia Athletics St. Louis Browns Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants would leave their original hometowns within the next five years.

Milwaukee Braves cap logo
As the 1950s progressed the reinvigorated Braves became increasingly competitive. Sluggers Eddie Mathews and Hank Aaron drove the offense (they would hit a combined 1226 home runs as Braves with 850 of those coming while the franchise was in Milwaukee) often aided by another power hitter Joe Adcock while Warren Spahn Lew Burdette and Bob Buhl anchored the rotation. The 1956 Braves finished second only one game behind the Brooklyn Dodgers.

In 1957 the Braves celebrated their first pennant in nine years spearheaded by Aaron's MVP season as he led the National League in home runs and RBI. Perhaps the most memorable of his 44 round-trippers that season came on September 23 a two-run walk-off home run that gave the Braves a 4–2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals and clinched the League championship. The team then went on to its first World Series win in over 40 years defeating the powerful New York Yankees of Berra Mantle and Ford in seven games. One-time Yankee Burdette the Series MVP threw three complete game victories against his former team giving up only two earned runs.

In 1958 the Braves again won the National League pennant and jumped out to a three games to one lead in the World Series against the New York Yankees once more thanks in part to the strength of Spahn's and Burdette's pitching. But the Yankees stormed back to take the last three games in large part to World Series MVP Bob Turley's pitching.

The 1959 season saw the Braves finish the season in a tie with the Los Angeles Dodgers both with 86-68 records. Many residents of Chicago and Milwaukee were hoping for a Sox-Braves Series as the cities are only about  apart but it was not to be because Milwaukee fell in a best-of-3 playoff with two straight losses to the Dodgers. The Dodgers would go on to defeat the Chicago White Sox in the World Series.

Milwaukee Braves logo (1953–1956)
The next six years were up-and-down for the Braves. The 1960 season featured two no-hitters by Burdette and Spahn and Milwaukee finished seven games behind the Pittsburgh Pirates who ultimately were to win the World Series that year in second place one year after the Braves were on the winning end of the 13-inning near-perfect game of Pirates pitcher Harvey Haddix. The 1961 season saw a drop in the standings for the Braves down to fourth despite Spahn recording his 300th victory and pitching another no-hitter that year.

Aaron hit 45 home runs in 1962 a Milwaukee career high for him but this did not translate into wins for the Braves as they finished fifth. The next season Aaron again hit 44 home runs and notched 130 RBI and Spahn was once again the ace of the staff going 23–7. However none of the other Braves produced at that level and the team finished in the lower half of the league or ""second division"" for the first time in its short history in Milwaukee.

The Braves were somewhat mediocre as the 1960s began but fattened up on the expansion New York Mets and Houston Colt .45s. To this day the Milwaukee Braves are the only major league team who played more than one season and never had a losing record.

Perini sold the Braves to a Chicago-based group led by William Bartholomay in 1962. Almost immediately Bartholomay started shopping the Braves to a larger television market. Keen to attract them the fast-growing city of Atlanta led by Mayor
Ivan Allen Jr. constructed a new $18 million 52000-seat ballpark in less than one year Atlanta Stadium which was officially opened in 1965 in hopes of luring an existing major league baseball and/or NFL/AFL team. After the city failed to lure the Kansas City A's to Atlanta (the A's would move to Oakland in 1968) the Braves announced their intention to move to Atlanta for the 1965 season. However an injunction filed in Wisconsin kept the Braves in Milwaukee for one final year. In 1966 the Braves completed the move to Atlanta.

Eddie Mathews is the only Braves player to have played for the organization in all three cities that they have been based in. Mathews played with the Braves for their last season in Boston the team's entire tenure in Milwaukee and their first season in Atlanta.

===Atlanta (1966–present)===

====1966–1974====
The Braves were a .500 team in their first few years in Atlanta; 85–77 in 1966 77–85 in 1967 and 81–81 in 1968. The 1967 season was the Braves' first losing season since 1952 their last year in Boston. In 1969 with the onset of divisional play the Braves won the first-ever National League West Division title before being swept by the ""Miracle Mets"" in the National League Championship Series. They would not be a factor during the next decade posting only two winning seasons between 1970 and 1981 – in some cases fielding teams as bad as the worst Boston teams.

The fence over which Hank Aaron hit his 715th career home run still exists outside of Turner Field.
In the meantime fans had to be satisfied with the achievements of Hank Aaron. In the relatively hitter-friendly confines and higher-than-average altitude of Atlanta Stadium (""The Launching Pad"") he actually increased his offensive production. Atlanta also produced batting champions in Rico Carty (in 1970) and Ralph Garr (in 1974). In the shadow of Aaron's historical home run pursuit was the fact that three Atlanta sluggers hit 40 or more home runs in 1973 – Darrell Evans Davey Johnson and of course Aaron.

By the end of the 1973 season Aaron had hit 713 home runs one short of Ruth's record. Throughout the winter he received racially motivated death threats but stood up well under the pressure. The next season it was only a matter of time before he set a new record. On April 4 opening day he hit No.714 in Cincinnati and on April 8 in front of his home fans and a national television audience he finally beat Ruth's mark with a home run to left-center field off left-hander Al Downing of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Aaron spent most of his career as a Milwaukee and Atlanta Brave before asking to be traded to the Milwaukee Brewers while Ruth finished his career as a Boston Brave. In fact until Barry Bonds eclipsed the 714 home runs hit by Babe Ruth in 2006 the top two home run hitters in Major League history had at one time been Braves.

====1976–1977: Ted Turner buys the team====
Media magnate Ted Turner purchased the team in 1976 and played a large role in the team's operation.

In 1976 the team was purchased by media magnate Ted Turner owner of superstation WTBS as a means to keep the team (and one of his main programming staples) in Atlanta. The financially strapped Turner used money already paid to the team for their broadcast rights as a down-payment. It was then that Atlanta Stadium was renamed Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium. Turner quickly gained a reputation as a quirky hands-on baseball owner. On May 11 1977 Turner appointed himself manager but because MLB passed a rule in the 1950s barring managers from holding a financial stake in their teams Turner was ordered to relinquish that position after one game (the Braves lost 2–1 to the Pittsburgh Pirates to bring their losing streak to 17 games).

Turner used the Braves as a major programming draw for his fledgling cable network making the Braves the first franchise to have a nationwide audience and fan base. WTBS marketed the team as ""The Atlanta Braves: America's Team"" a nickname that still sticks in some areas of the country especially the South. Among other things in 1976 Turner suggested the nickname ""Channel"" for pitcher Andy Messersmith and jersey number 17 in order to promote the television station that aired Braves games. Major League Baseball quickly nixed the idea.

====1978–1990====
Phil Niekro played with the Braves from 1964 to 1983 and in 1987; he holds the MLB record for most wins by a knuckleball pitcher

After three straight losing seasons Bobby Cox was hired for his first stint as manager for the 1978 season. He promoted 22-year-old slugger Dale Murphy into the starting lineup. Murphy hit 77 home runs over the next three seasons but he struggled on defense unable to adeptly play either catcher or first base. In 1980 Murphy was moved to center field and demonstrated excellent range and throwing ability while the Braves earned their first winning season since 1974. Cox was fired after the 1981 season and replaced with Joe Torre under whose leadership the Braves attained their first divisional title since 1969. Strong performances from Bob Horner Chris Chambliss pitcher Phil Niekro and short relief pitcher Gene Garber helped the Braves but no Brave was more acclaimed than Murphy who won both a Most Valuable Player and a Gold Glove award. Murphy also won an MVP award the following season but the Braves began a period of decline that defined the team throughout the 1980s. Murphy excelling in defense hitting and running was consistently recognized as one of the league's best players but the Braves averaged only 65 wins per season between 1985 and 1990. Their lowest point came in 1988 when they lost 106 games. The 1986 season saw the return of Bobby Cox as general manager. Also in 1986 the team stopped using their Indian-themed mascot Chief Noc-A-Homa.

====1991–2004: Division dominance====

=====1991–1994=====


Cox returned to the dugout as manager in the middle of the 1990 season replacing Russ Nixon. The Braves finished the year with the worst record in baseball at 65–97. They traded Dale Murphy to the Philadelphia Phillies after it was clear he was becoming a less dominant player. Pitching coach Leo Mazzone began developing young pitchers Tom Glavine Steve Avery and John Smoltz into future stars. That same year the Braves used the number one overall pick in the 1990 MLB draft to select Chipper Jones who became one of the best hitters in team history. Perhaps the Braves' most important move was not on the field but in the front office. Immediately after the season John Schuerholz was hired away from the Kansas City Royals as general manager.

The following season Glavine Avery and Smoltz would be recognized as the best young pitchers in the league winning 52 games among them. Meanwhile behind position players David Justice Ron Gant and unexpected league Most Valuable Player and batting champion Terry Pendleton the Braves overcame a 39–40 start winning 55 of their final 83 games over the last three months of the season and edging the Los Angeles Dodgers by one game in one of baseball's more memorable playoff races. The ""Worst to First"" Braves who had not won a divisional title since 1982 captivated the city of Atlanta (and the entire southeast) during their improbable run to the flag. They defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in a very tightly contested seven-game NLCS only to lose the World Series also in seven games to the Minnesota Twins. The series considered by many to be one of the greatest ever was the first time a team that had finished last in its division one year went to the World Series the next; both the Twins and Braves accomplished the feat.

Despite the 1991 World Series loss the Braves' success would continue. In 1992 the Braves returned to the NLCS and once again defeated the Pirates in seven games culminating in a dramatic game seven win. Francisco Cabrera's two-out single that scored David Justice and Sid Bream capped a three-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning that gave the Braves a 3–2 victory. It was the first time in post season history that the tying and winning runs had scored on a single play in the ninth inning. The Braves lost the World Series to the Toronto Blue Jays however. In 1993 the Braves signed Cy Young Award winning pitcher Greg Maddux from the Chicago Cubs leading many baseball insiders to declare the team's pitching staff the best in baseball. The 1993 team posted a franchise-best 104 wins after a dramatic pennant race with the San Francisco Giants who won 103 games. The Braves needed a stunning 55–19 finish to edge out the Giants who led the Braves by nine games in the standings as late as August 11. However the Braves fell in the NLCS to the Philadelphia Phillies in six games.

In 1994 in a realignment of the National League's divisions following the 1993 expansion the Braves moved to the Eastern Division. This realignment was the main cause of the team's heated rivalry with the New York Mets during the mid-to-late 1990s.

The player's strike cut short the 1994 season prior to the division championships with the Braves six games behind the Montreal Expos with 48 games left to play.

=====1995–2004=====
The Braves returned strong the following strike-shortened (144 games instead of the customary 162) year and beat the Cleveland Indians in the 1995 World Series. This squelched claims by many Braves critics that they were the ""Buffalo Bills of Baseball"" (January 1996 issue of ''Beckett Baseball Card Monthly''). With this World Series victory the Braves became the first team in Major League Baseball to win world championships in three different cities. With their strong pitching as a constant the Braves appeared in the  and 1999 World Series (losing both to the New York Yankees managed by Joe Torre a former Braves manager) and had a streak of division titles from 1991 to 2005 (three in the Western Division and eleven in the Eastern) interrupted only in 1994 when the strike ended the season early. Pitching was not the only constant in the Braves organization —Cox was the Braves' manager while Schuerholz remained the team's GM until after the 2007 season when he was promoted to team president. Terry Pendleton finished his playing career elsewhere but returned to the Braves system as the hitting coach.

In October 1996 Time Warner acquired Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System and all of its assets including its cable channels and the Atlanta Braves. Over the next few years Ted Turner's presence as owner of the team would diminish.

A 95–67 record in  produced a ninth consecutive division title. However a sweep by the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Division Series prevented the Braves from reaching the NL Championship Series.

In 2001 Atlanta won the National League East division yet again swept the Houston Astros in the NLDS then lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League Championship Series four games to one. One memorable game the Braves played that year came on September 21 when they played rival New York Mets in the first major professional sporting event held in New York City since 9/11.

In 2002 2003 and 2004 the Braves won the Eastern division again but lost in the NLDS in all three years in the same fashion: 3 games to 2 to the San Francisco Giants Chicago Cubs and Houston Astros.

=====Cy Young dominance=====
Six National League Cy Young Awards in the 1990s were awarded to three Braves pitchers:
* In 1991 left-handed pitcher Tom Glavine received his first award.
* Right-handed pitcher Greg Maddux won four in a row three of them with the Braves from 1993 through 1995. His first award came in 1992 with the Cubs.
* In 1996 right-handed pitcher John Smoltz received his only Cy Young Award.
* In 1998 Glavine won his second.

====2005: A new generation====


In 2005 the Braves won the Division championship for the 14th consecutive time from 1991 to 2005. 14 consecutive division titles stands as the record for all major league baseball. The 2005 title marked the first time any MLB team made the postseason with more than 4 rookies who each had more than 100 ABs (Wilson Betemit Brian McCann Pete Orr Ryan Langerhans Jeff Francoeur). Catcher Brian McCann right fielder Jeff Francoeur and pitcher Kyle Davies all grew up in the suburbs of Atlanta. The large number of rookies to debut in 2005 were nicknamed the ""Baby Braves"" by fans and became an Atlanta-area sensation helping to lead the club to a record of 90–72.

However the season would end on a sour note as the Braves lost the National League Division Series to the Astros in four games. In Game 4 with the Braves leading by 5 in the eighth inning the Astros battled back with a Lance Berkman grand slam and a two-out ninth inning Brad Ausmus home run off of Braves closer Kyle Farnsworth. The game did not end until the 18th inning becoming the longest game in playoff history at 5 hours 50 minutes. Chris Burke ended the marathon with a home run off of Joey Devine.

After the 2005 season the Braves lost their long-time pitching coach Leo Mazzone who left to go to the Baltimore Orioles. Roger McDowell took his place in the Atlanta dugout. Unable to re-sign shortstop Rafael Furcal the Braves acquired shortstop Édgar Rentería from the Boston Red Sox.

====2006: Struggles====

Andruw Jones at bat for the Braves in 2006

In 2006 the Braves did not perform at the level they had grown accustomed to. Due to an offensive slump injuries to their starting rotation and subpar bullpen performances the Braves compiled a 6–21 record during June the worst month ever in Atlanta with a winning percentage of .222; this was only better than the woeful Boston Braves in May 1935 (4–20) with a .166 winning percentage.

After the break the Braves came out with their bats swinging setting many franchise records. They won five straight sweeping the Padres and taking two from the Cardinals tallying a total of 65 runs in that span. The 65 runs in five games is the best by the franchise since 1897 when the Boston Beaneaters totaled 78 including 25 in one game and 21 in another from May 31 – June 3; the 2006 Braves also became the first team since the 1930 New York Yankees to score ten runs or more in five straight games. The Braves had a total of 81 hits during their five-game run and 98 hits in their last six games going back to an 8–3 victory over Cincinnati on July 9 the last game before the All-Star break. Additionally Chipper Jones was able to maintain a 20-game hitting streak and tie Paul Waner's 69-year-old Major League record with a 14-game extra-base hit streak.

However on September 18 the New York Mets' win over the Florida Marlins mathematically eliminated the Braves from winning the NL East ending the Atlanta Braves' 11-year reign over the NL East. On September 24 the Braves' loss to the Colorado Rockies mathematically eliminated the Braves from winning the NL Wild Card making 2006 the first year that the Braves would not compete in the postseason since 1990 not counting the strike-shortened 1994 season. Also a loss to the Mets on September 28 guaranteed the Braves their first losing season since 1990. Although the Braves won two of their last three games against the Astros including rookie Chuck James besting Roger Clemens Atlanta finished the season in third place one game ahead of the Marlins at 79–83.

====Sale to Liberty Media====
In December 2005 team owner Time Warner who inherited the Braves after purchasing TBS in 1996 announced it was placing the team for sale. Liberty Media began negotiations to purchase the team.

In February 2007 after more than a year of negotiations Time Warner agreed to a deal that would sell the Braves to Liberty Media Group (a company which owned a large amount of stock in Time Warner Inc.) pending approval by 75 percent of MLB owners and the Commissioner of Baseball Bud Selig. The deal included the exchange of the Braves valued in the deal at $450 million a hobbyist magazine publishing company and $980 million cash for 68.5 million shares of Time Warner stock held by Liberty Media then worth approximately $1.48 billion. Team President Terry McGuirk anticipated no change in the current front office structure personnel or day-to-day operations of the Braves. Liberty Media is not expected to take any type of ""active"" ownership in terms of day-to-day operations.

On May 16 2007 Major League Baseball's owners approved the sale of the Braves from Time Warner to Liberty Media. The Braves are one of three Major League Baseball teams under corporate ownership (and the only NL team with this distinction); the other two franchises are the American League (AL)'s Seattle Mariners (which are owned by Nintendo of America) and the Toronto Blue Jays (which are owned by Rogers Communications).

====2007: More struggles====

On July 5 Chipper Jones surpassed Dale Murphy for the Atlanta club record of 372 home runs by belting two against the Los Angeles Dodgers.

After struggling during the second half of the 2007 season Atlanta finished over .500 and missed the post season again. On October 12 2007 John Schuerholz stepped down as General Manager to take over as team president. Assistant GM Frank Wren took over as General Manager.

====2009: The return of solid pitching====

Kenshin Kawakami pitching for the Braves in 2009

On December 4 2008 the Atlanta Braves received Javier Vázquez and Boone Logan while the Chicago White Sox received prospects catcher Tyler Flowers shortstop Brent Lillibridge third baseman Jon Gilmore and pitcher Santos Rodriguez.  On January 13 2009 the Braves signed Japanese pitcher Kenshin Kawakami to a three-year deal and two days later signed free agent pitcher Derek Lowe to a four-year contract. During the course of the offseason the Braves signed veteran pitcher and former Brave Tom Glavine while losing long-time Brave John Smoltz to the Boston Red Sox.

On February 25 2009 just before the start of spring training Atlanta agreed to terms on a one-year contract with free-agent outfielder Garret Anderson. The additional outfield depth allowed the Braves to trade Josh Anderson to the Detroit Tigers for minor league pitcher Rudy Darrow on March 30 2009.

On June 3 2009 the Braves acquired Nate McLouth from the Pittsburgh Pirates for prospects Jeff Locke Charlie Morton and Gorkys Hernández. They also released veteran pitcher Tom Glavine. On July 10 2009 the Braves traded outfielder Jeff Francoeur to the New York Mets for outfielder Ryan Church. On July 31 2009 hours before the trade deadline the Braves and Boston Red Sox swapped 1st basemen: Atlanta dealt Casey Kotchman to Boston and reacquired Adam LaRoche whom the Braves had traded away during the 2006–07 off-season to Pittsburgh.

The Braves made a late-season surge coming within 2 games of the wild card leading Colorado Rockies in late September. On October 1 2009 with the Braves four games back Colorado beat the Milwaukee Brewers 9–2 to clinch the wild card spot and end the Braves' 2009 postseason hopes.

====2010: Cox's final season====

Braves manager Bobby Cox retired in 2010 after 25 years of management

The 2010 Atlanta Braves Season features the Braves' attempt to reclaim a postseason berth for the first time since 2005. The Braves were once again skippered by Bobby Cox now in his 25th and final season managing the team. The Braves started the 2010 season slowly and had a nine-game losing streak in April. Then they had a nine-game winning streak from May 26 through June 3 the Braves longest since 2000 when they won 16 in a row. On May 31 the Atlanta Braves defeated the then-first place Philadelphia Phillies at Turner Field to take sole possession of first place in the National League East standings a position they had maintained through the middle of August. The last time the Atlanta Braves led the NL East on August 1 was in 2005. On July 13 2010 at the 2010 MLB All-Star Game in Anaheim Braves catcher Brian McCann was awarded the All-Star Game MVP Award for his clutch two-out three-run double in the seventh inning to give the National League its first win in the All-Star Game since 1996. He became the first Brave to win the All-Star Game MVP Award since Fred McGriff did so in 1994. The Braves made two deals before the trade deadline to acquire Álex González Rick Ankiel and Kyle Farnsworth from the Toronto Blue Jays and Kansas City Royals giving up shortstop Yunel Escobar pitchers Jo-Jo Reyes and Jesse Chavez outfielder Gregor Blanco and three minor leaguers. On August 18 2010 they traded three pitching prospects for first baseman Derrek Lee from the Chicago Cubs. On August 22 2010 against the Chicago Cubs Mike Minor struck out 12 batters across 6 innings; an Atlanta Braves single game rookie strikeout record. The Braves dropped to second in the NL East in early September but won the NL Wild Card. They lost to the San Francisco Giants in the National League Division Series in four games. Every game of the series was determined by one run. After the series-clinching victory for the Giants in Game 4 Bobby Cox was given a standing ovation by the fans also by players and coaches of both the Braves and Giants.

====2011: Fredi González takes over====

closer Craig Kimbrel pitching in 2011

On October 13 2010 the Atlanta Braves announced that Fredi González would replace long-time Braves manager Bobby Cox as manager of the team in 2011. The announcement came just two days after the 2010 Braves were eliminated from the postseason. It was also announced that pitching coach Roger McDowell third-base coach Brian Snitker and bullpen coach Eddie Pérez would retain their current positions while former hitting coach Terry Pendleton would replace Glenn Hubbard as the first-base coach and newcomer Carlos Tosca would become the new bench coach. Hubbard and former bench coach Chino Cadahia were not offered positions on the new coaching staff. Larry Parrish was hired as hitting coach on October 29 2010.

On November 16 2010 in an offseason trade the Braves acquired Dan Uggla from the Florida Marlins in exchange for left-handed reliever Mike Dunn and infielder Omar Infante. According to Elias Sports Bureau the Braves had an all-time franchise win-loss record over .500 for the first time since 1923 after their win over the Houston Astros on June 11 2011. The Braves franchise became the third franchise in MLB history to reach 10000 wins with their win over the Washington Nationals on July 15 2011. On July 31 2011 just sixteen days after registering their 10000th win the Florida Marlins defeated the Braves by a score of 3-1 handing the team the 10000th loss in franchise history. The Braves become only the second team in big league history with 10000 losses after the Philadelphia Phillies reached the plateau in 2007.

Players from the Braves' farm system such as Freddie Freeman and Brandon Beachy played regularly with the big league club while Julio Teherán Randall Delgado and Mike Minor were called up for spot starts. With late season injuries to starters Jair Jurrjens and Tommy Hanson these three young pitchers made their way into the starting rotation in their absence. Eight players made their major league debuts for the team in 2011.

=====September collapse=====
The Braves led the National League Wild Card standings for much of the 2011 season with the division-rival Philadelphia Phillies firmly in control of first place in the National League East. The Braves entered the final month of the regular season 25 games above .500 with a record of 80–55 and an -game lead in the Wild Card standings. The nearest team trailing them the St. Louis Cardinals who also trailed the National League Central-leading Milwaukee Brewers by  games at the time were considered a long-shot to gain a spot in the postseason. Just days prior on August 26 the Cardinals found themselves  games behind and in third place.

With 27 games to play the Braves went 9–18 in September to finish the season with a record of 89–73. The Cardinals meanwhile went 18–8 to finish at 90–72. Braves closer Craig Kimbrel who had not surrendered a single earned run in July or August carried a 4.76 ERA in September with three blown saves. After being dominant in his role for much of the season Braves setup man Jonny Venters posted a 5.11 September ERA. These sharp declines in both relievers led many critics to question the handling of the bullpen by Braves manager Fredi González. Veteran starter Derek Lowe posted a win-loss record of 0–5 in September with an ERA of 8.75. Shortly into the offseason Lowe would be traded to the Cleveland Indians. The Braves starters lasted six or more innings only three times over the last 23 games. Over the last five games all of which were losses for the Braves the team managed to score only seven runs. Braves catcher Brian McCann often regarded as the best offensive catcher in the Majors hit only .183 with two home runs in September. The offense as a whole hit for only a .235 batting average and a .300 on-base percentage in September both second-worst in the National League. The .195 RISP average by Braves hitters was second worst in the Majors. Hitting coach Larry Parrish was fired two days following the last game of the season.

====2012: Chipper's last season====
Chipper Jones salutes the crowd at Turner Field prior to his final regular season game on September 30 2012. Jones announced he would retire after 19 seasons with the Braves

In 2012 the Braves began their 138th season after an upsetting end to the 2011 season. On March 22 the Braves announced that third baseman Chipper Jones would retire following the 2012 season after 19 Major League seasons with the team. The Braves also lost many key players through trades or free agency including pitcher Derek Lowe shortstop Alex González and outfielder Nate McLouth. To compensate for this the team went on to receive many key players such as outfielder Michael Bourn along with shortstops Tyler Pastornicky and Andrelton Simmons. To fill the void of a quality starting pitcher left by Lowe (as well as a mid-season injury to Brandon Beachy) manager Fredi González elected relief pitcher Kris Medlen to the starting pitching rotation. The Braves went on to win every game Medlen started setting the MLB record for most consecutive wins when a single pitcher starts (total of 23). Atlanta stayed close to the Washington Nationals in the race to win the National League East title. They also stayed on top of the National League Wild Card race. Washington ended up winning their first division title in franchise history but the Braves remained in first place of the NL wild card race. Keeping with a new MLB rule for the 2012 season the top two wild card teams in each league must play each other in a playoff game before entering into the Division Series.

The Braves played the St. Louis Cardinals in the first ever Wild Card Game. The Braves were behind 6–3 in the bottom of the eighth inning when Andrelton Simmons hit a fly ball to left field that dropped in between the Cardinals shortstop and left fielder. Umpire Sam Holbrook called Simmons out citing the infield fly rule. Had an infield fly not been called Simmons would have been credited with a single and Atlanta would have had the bases loaded with one out. Fans at Turner Field began to litter the field with debris prompting the game to be delayed for 19 minutes. The Braves lost the game 6–3 ending their season.

====2013: Braves win the East====

Evan Gattis catching for the Braves in 2013

During the offseason following a gut wrenching exit against the St. Louis Cardinals in the Wild Card Game the Braves spent the 2012–2013 offseason revamping and retooling their offense. The Braves turned heads across baseball by acquiring B.J. Upton from the Tampa Bay Rays signing him to a 5-year $75.25 million contract and making him their starting center fielder and uniting him with his younger brother Justin Upton from the Arizona Diamondbacks in a seven player trade that sent fan favorite utility man Martín Prado to the Diamondbacks they also filled a need for a new Third Baseman in Chris Johnson after the retirement of Chipper Jones the previous year. The Braves began the 2013 season with a hot start in April by going 17-9 for the month which saw the emergence of rookie sensation Evan Gattis while taking hold of first place in the National League East division a lead they would never relinquish for the rest of the season. The Braves suffered many injuries to key players throughout the season including injuries to Jason Heyward Brian McCann Freddie Freeman Eric O'Flaherty Jonny Venters Ramiro Pena and others but found a way to win despite these blows to the team. Leading up to the All Star break First Baseman Freddie Freeman was voted in to play for the 2013 National League All-Star Team in the 2013 All Star Game which he did not play. The Braves also witnessed the emergence of rookie pitcher Julio Teherán after much hype during Spring training. From July 26 to August 10 the Braves won 14 games in a row.  The winning streak was the longest of its kind since April–May 2000.

On June 28 2013 the Atlanta Braves retired former third baseman Chipper Jones' jersey number 10 before the game against the Arizona Diamondbacks. He was honored before 51300 fans at Turner Field in Atlanta. He served as a staple of the Braves franchise for 19 years before announcing his retirement at the beginning of the 2012 season. Chipper Jones played his last regular season game for the Braves on September 30 2012.

The Braves opened up a 15-game lead on the Washington Nationals in the National League East on September 3 2013 riding that lead en route to its first division title since 2005 the last of 14 straight division titles. This was also Braves manager Fredi González's first division title since beginning his managerial career in 1990; including his first since becoming the manager of the Braves after the 2010 season. The Braves clinched the 18th division title in team history on September 22 2013 after a Nationals loss to the Marlins in the first game of a double header; the Braves also won their game that day beating the Chicago Cubs 5-2 at Wrigley Field.

After clinching the division title they lost to the Dodgers 3-1 in the Division Series.

====2014: Losing season====
Jason Heyward runs the bases in 2014

On November 11 2013 the Braves announced that they would vacate Turner Field for a new stadium in Cobb County in the northwest suburbs outside of Atlanta in 2017. The move is to follow the expiration of the Braves' 20-year lease on Turner Field in 2016. The new stadium is to be constructed in a public/private partnership.  During the offseason the Braves signed few of their young talents to multi year contracts; Craig Kimbrel (4 years/$42M) Freddie Freeman (8 years/$135M) Kris Medlen (1 year/$5.8M) Jason Heyward (2 years/$13.3M) Julio Teherán (6 years/$32.4M) and Andrelton Simmons (7 years/$58M).

The Braves finished the season in a distant second place with a 79-83 record which was their first losing season since 2008 and only their third since 1990.

====2015–2016: Rebuilding====
Prior to the 2015 season the Braves fired their General Manager Frank Wren and John Hart replaced him as interim general manager choosing to only take the title of President of Baseball Operations. The Braves promptly traded Gold Glove Award winner Jason Heyward to the St. Louis Cardinals along with pitcher Jordan Walden for pitchers Shelby Miller and Tyrell Jenkins. Hart would then trade All Star left fielder Justin Upton to the San Diego Padres for Max Fried Jace Peterson Dustin Peterson and Mallex Smith. Catcher Evan Gattis and minor league prospect James Hoyt were traded to the Houston Astros for minor leaguers Mike Foltynewicz Rio Ruiz and Andrew Thurman. A day before the season began the Braves made a final trade involving former All- Star Craig Kimbrel and outfielder Melvin Upton Jr.. They were traded to the San Diego Padres for outfielders Cameron Maybin and Carlos Quentin along with two minor league players. By the beginning of the season the Braves did 11 trades in all.

Prior to the start of the 2016 regular season the Braves continued their offseason rebuilding by trading Andrelton Simmons to the Los Angeles Angels for Erick Aybar and pitching prospects Sean Newcomb and Chris Ellis and $2.5 million. They agreed to 1 year contracts with Kelly Johnson Chris Withrow and Arodys Vizcaino and agreed to terms on a minor league contract for Carlos Torres and Jeff Francoeur. The Braves would end up purchasing the Major League contract of Francoeur.

On April 13 2016 Hector Olivera was arrested and charged with the assault of a woman at the team hotel when the Braves were in Washington D.C. facing the Nationals. He was placed on Administrative Leave by Major League Baseball and was placed on the Braves Restricted List until further disciplinary action is given.

The Braves began the season on a nine-game losing streak which is the worst opening by the franchise since 1988 when they dropped the first 10 games of that season.

After a 9–28 start in 2016 Fredi González was fired on May 17 and replaced by third base coach Brian Snitker as interim general manager. Snitker replaced González once before in the 2006–07 off-season as the Braves third base coach when González left the Braves to manage the Marlins.

The Braves finished the season 68-93 and in last place in NL East.

During the 2016 off-season the Braves signed pitchers R.A. Dickey and Bartolo Colón and promoted interim manager Brian Snitker to full-time manager.

"
147,Akira Kurosawa,Legacy,"===Legacy of general criticism===

Criticism of Kurosawa in his legacy has significantly followed a close parity between the main currents of domestic criticism his films received when they were released in Japan with the international reception his individual films received when released abroad during his lifetime. Since the early to mid-1950s a number of critics from the French New Wave championed the films of the older Japanese master Kenji Mizoguchi at the expense of Kurosawa's work. New Wave critic-filmmaker Jacques Rivette said: ""You can compare only what is comparable and that which aims high enough ... Mizoguchi seems to be the only Japanese director who is completely Japanese and yet is also the only one that achieves a true universality that of an individual."" According to such French commentators Mizoguchi seemed of the two artists the more authentically Japanese. But at least one film scholar has questioned the validity of this dichotomy between ""Japanese"" Mizoguchi and ""Western"" Kurosawa by pointing out that ""Mizo"" had been as influenced by Western cinema and Western culture in general as Kurosawa and that this is reflected in his work.

In Japan there have been critics and other filmmakers who have accused his work of elitism because of his focus on exceptional heroic individuals and groups of men. In her DVD commentary on ''Seven Samurai'' Joan Mellen maintains that certain shots of the samurai characters Kambei and Kyuzo which to her reveal Kurosawa ""privileging"" these samurai ""support the argument voiced by several Japanese critics that Kurosawa was an elitist ... Kurosawa was hardly a progressive director they argued since his peasants could not discover among their own ranks leaders who might rescue the village ... Kurosawa defended himself against this charge in his interview with me. 'I wanted to say that after everything the peasants were the stronger closely clinging to the earth ... It was the samurai who were weak because they were being blown by the winds of time.

Owing to Kurosawa's popularity with European and American audiences from the early 1950s onward he has not escaped the charge of deliberately catering to the tastes of Westerners to achieve or maintain that popularity. Joan Mellen recording the violently negative reaction (in the 1970s) of the left-wing director Nagisa Oshima to Kurosawa and his work states: ""That Kurosawa had brought Japanese film to a Western audience meant to Oshima that he must be pandering to Western values and politics."" Kurosawa always strongly denied pandering to Western tastes: ""He has never catered to a foreign audience"" writes Audie Bock ""and has condemned those who do"".

===Reputation among filmmakers===

Many celebrated directors have been influenced by Kurosawa and have expressed admiration for his work. The filmmakers cited below can be presented according to four categories: (a) those who like Kurosawa himself established international critical reputations in the 1950s and early 1960s; (b) the so-called ""New Hollywood"" directors that is American moviemakers who for the most part established their reputations in the early to mid-1970s; (c) other Asian directors; and (d) modern-day directors.

A bust of the Swedish director Ingmar Bergman located in Poland. Kurosawa was several years Bergman's senior and admired him as a fellow craftsman writing him a commemorative letter at his 70th birthday.
The Swedish director Ingmar Bergman called his own film ''The Virgin Spring'' ""touristic a lousy imitation of Kurosawa"" and added ""At that time my admiration for the Japanese cinema was at its height. I was almost a samurai myself!"" In Italy Federico Fellini in an interview declared the director ""the greatest living example of all that an author of the cinema should be""—despite admitting to having seen only one of his films ''Seven Samurai''. In France Roman Polanski in 1965 cited Kurosawa as one of his three favorite filmmakers (with Fellini and Orson Welles) singling out ''Seven Samurai'' ''Throne of Blood'' and ''The Hidden Fortress'' for praise. The Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci considered the Japanese master's influence to be seminal: ""Kurosawa's movies and ''La Dolce Vita'' of Fellini are the things that pushed me sucked me into being a film director."" German New Wave director Werner Herzog has cited Kurosawa as one of his greatest influences: ""Of the filmmakers with whom I feel some kinship Griffith ... Buñuel Kurosawa and Eisenstein's ''Ivan the Terrible'' all come to mind."" When asked to list his favorite directors Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky cited Kurosawa as one of his favorites and named ''Seven Samurai'' as one of his ten favorite films.

Kurosawa's New Hollywood admirers have included Robert Altman Francis Ford Coppola Steven Spielberg Martin Scorsese George Lucas and John Milius. In his early years while still a television director Robert Altman stated that when he first saw ''Rashomon'' he was so impressed by its cinematographer's achievement of shooting several shots with the camera aimed directly at the sun—allegedly it was the first film in which this was done successfully—that he claims he was inspired the very next day to begin incorporating shots of the sun into his television work. It was Coppola who said of Kurosawa ""One thing that distinguishes him is that he didn't make one masterpiece or two masterpieces. He made you know ''eight'' masterpieces."" Both Spielberg and Scorsese have praised the older man's role as teacher and role model and Scorsese called him his ""''sensei''"" using the Japanese term. Spielberg has declared ""I have learned more from him than from almost any other filmmaker on the face of the earth"" while Scorsese remarked ""Let me say it simply: Akira Kurosawa was my master and ... the master of so many other filmmakers over the years."" Several of these moviemakers were also instrumental in helping Kurosawa obtain financing for his late films: Lucas and Coppola served as co-producers on ''Kagemusha'' while the Spielberg name lent to the 1990 production ''Dreams'' helped bring that picture to fruition.

As the first Asian filmmaker to achieve international prominence Kurosawa has naturally served as an inspiration for other Asian ''auteurs''. Of ''Rashomon'' the most famous director of India Satyajit Ray said: ""The effect of the film on me upon first seeing it in Calcutta in 1952 was electric. I saw it three times on consecutive days and wondered each time if there was another film anywhere which gave such sustained and dazzling proof of a director's command over every aspect of film making."" Other Asian admirers include the Japanese actor and director Takeshi Kitano Hong Kong filmmaker John Woo Japanese anime director Hayao Miyazaki and mainland Chinese director Zhang Yimou who called Kurosawa ""the quintessential Asian director"".

Even today Kurosawa continues to inspire and influence contemporary filmmakers. Alexander Payne spent the early part of his career watching Kurosawa's films most notably ''Seven Samurai'' and ''Ikiru''. Guillermo del Toro referred to Kurosawa ""one of the essential masters"" citing ''Throne of Blood'' ''High and Low'' and ''Ran'' as among his favorite films. Kathryn Bigelow praised Kurosawa as one of ""high-impact filmmakers"" who can create emotionally invested characters. J.J. Abrams says he drew from Kurosawa while making ''Star Wars: the Force Awakens''. At the age of 19 Alejandro González Iñárritu remembers being spellbound when he first saw ''Ikiru'' and praises Kurosawa as ""one of the first storytelling geniuses who began to change the narrative structure of films."" When Spike Lee posted a list of 87 films every aspiring director should see he included three Kurosawa movies: ''Rashomon'' ''Yojimbo'' and ''Ran''.

===Posthumous screenplays===

Following Kurosawa's death several posthumous works based on his unfilmed screenplays have been produced. ''After the Rain'' directed by Takashi Koizumi was released in 1998 and ''The Sea is Watching'' directed by Kei Kumai premiered in 2002. A script created by the Yonki no Kai (""Club of the Four Knights"") (Kurosawa Keisuke Kinoshita Masaki Kobayashi and Kon Ichikawa) around the time that ''Dodeskaden'' was made finally was filmed and released (in 2000) as ''Dora-Heita'' by the only surviving founding member of the club Kon Ichikawa. Huayi Brothers Media and CKF Pictures in China announced in 2017 plans to produce a film of Kurosawa's posthumous screenplay of ''The Masque of the Black Death'' by Edgar Allan Poe for 2020. Patrick Frater writing for ''Variety'' magazine in May 2017 stated that another two unfinished films by Kurosawa were planned with ''Silvering Spear'' to start filming in 2018.

===Kurosawa Production Company===
Kurosawa Production Co. established in 1959 continues to oversee many of the aspects of Kurosawa's legacy. The director's son Hisao Kurosawa is the current head of the company. Its American subsidiary Kurosawa Enterprises is located in Los Angeles. Rights to Kurosawa's works are held by Kurosawa Production and the film studios under which he worked most notably Toho. Kurosawa Production works closely with the Akira Kurosawa Foundation established in December 2003 and also run by Hisao Kurosawa. The foundation organizes an annual short film competition and spearheads Kurosawa-related projects including a recently shelved one to build a memorial museum for the director.

===Film studios and awards===

In 1981 the Kurosawa Film Studio was opened in Yokohama; two additional locations have since been launched in Japan. A large collection of archive material including scanned screenplays photos and news articles has been made available through the Akira Kurosawa Digital Archive a Japanese proprietary website maintained by Ryukoku University Digital Archives Research Center in collaboration with Kurosawa Production. Anaheim University's Akira Kurosawa School of Film was launched in spring 2009 with the backing of Kurosawa Production. It offers online programs in digital film making with headquarters in Anaheim and a learning center in Tokyo.

Two film awards have also been named in Kurosawa's honor. The Akira Kurosawa Award for Lifetime Achievement in Film Directing is awarded during the San Francisco International Film Festival while the Akira Kurosawa Award is given during the Tokyo International Film Festival. In 1999 he was named ""Asian of the Century"" in the ""Arts Literature and Culture"" category by ''AsianWeek'' magazine and CNN cited as ""one of the five people who contributed most to the betterment of Asia in the past 100 years"". In commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Kurosawa's birth in 2010 a project called AK100 was launched in 2008. The AK100 Project aims to ""expose young people who are the representatives of the next generation and all people everywhere to the light and spirit of Akira Kurosawa and the wonderful world he created.""

Anaheim University in cooperation with the Kurosawa Family established the Anaheim University Akira Kurosawa School of Film to offer online and blended learning programs on Akira Kurosawa and filmmaking. The animated Wes Anderson film ''Isle of Dogs'' is partially inspired by Kurosawa's filming techniques. At the 64th Sydney Film Festival there was a retrospective of Akira Kurosawa where films of his were screened to remember the great legacy he has created from his work.

816,Heathenry in the United States,History,"Ásatrú grew steadily in the United States during the 1960s. In 1969 the Danish Odinist Else Christensen established the Odinist Fellowship from her home in Florida U.S.A. Heavily influenced by Alexander Rud Mills' writings she began publication of a magazine ''The Odinist'' although this focused to a greater extent on right-wing and racialist ideas than theological ones. Stephen McNallen first founded the Viking Brotherhood in the early 1970s before creating the Ásatrú Free Assembly (AFA) in 1976 which broke up in 1986 amid widespread political disagreements after McNallen's repudiation of neo-Nazis within the group. In the 1990s McNallen founded the Ásatrú Folk Assembly (AFA) an ethnically oriented Heathen group headquartered in California.

Meanwhile Valgard Murray and his kindred in Arizona founded the Ásatrú Alliance (AA) in the late 1980s which shared the AFA's perspectives on race and which published the ''Vor Tru'' newsletter. In 1987 Edred Thorsson and James Chisholm founded The Troth which was incorporated in Texas. Taking an inclusive non-racialist view it soon grew into an international organisation.

566,Alfonso II of Asturias,Early life,"He was born in Oviedo in 759 or 760. He was put under the guardianship of his aunt Adosinda after his father's death but one tradition relates his being put in the monastery of Samos. He was the governor of the palace during the reign of Adosinda's husband Silo. On Silo's death he was elected king by Adosinda's allies but the magnates raised his uncle Mauregatus to the throne instead. Alfonso fled to Álava where he found shelter with his maternal relatives. Mauregatus was succeeded by Bermudo Alfonso's cousin who abdicated after his defeat at the Battle of the Burbia River.

787,Alpha compositing,Analytical derivation of the over operator,"
Porter and Duff gave a geometric interpretation of the alpha compositing formula by studying orthogonal coverages. Another derivation of the formula based on a physical reflectance/transmittance model can be found in a 1981 paper by Bruce A. Wallace.

A third approach is found by starting out with two very simple assumptions. For simplicity we shall here use the shorthand notation  for representing the '''over''' operator.

The first assumption is that in the case where the background is opaque (i.e. ) the over operator represents the convex combination of  and :

:

The second assumption is that the operator must respect the associative rule:

:

Now let us assume that  and  have variable transparencies whereas  is opaque. We're interested in finding

:.

We know from the associative rule that the following must be true:

:

We know that  is opaque and thus follows that  is opaque so in the above equation each  operator can be written as a convex combination:

:

Hence we see that this represents an equation of the form . By setting  and  we get

:
which means that we have analytically derived a formula for the output alpha and the output color of .

An even more compact representation is given by noticing that :

:

It is also interesting to note that the  operator fulfills all the requirements of a non-commutative monoid where the identity element  is chosen such that  (i.e. the identity element can be any tuple  with .)

A Latin school was first recorded in Aalen in 1447; it was remodeled in 1616 and also later in various buildings that were all situated near the town church and continued up through the 19th century. In the course of the reformation a ""German school"" was established in tandem being a predecessor of the latter Volksschule school type. In 1860 the ''Ritterschule'' was built as a ''Volksschule'' for girls; the building today houses the ''Pestalozzischule''. In 1866 a new building was erected for the Latin school and for the Realschule established in 1840. This building later known as the ''Alte Gewerbeschule'' was torn down in 1975 to free up land for the new town hall. In 1912 the ''Parkschule'' building was opened.

1035,Agent Orange,Development,"Several herbicides were discovered as part of efforts by the USA and the British to develop herbicidal weapons for use during World War II. These included 24-D (24-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) 245-T (coded LN-14 and also known as trioxone) MCPA (2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid 1414B and 1414A recoded LN-8 and LN-32) and isopropyl phenylcarbamate (1313 recoded LN-33).

In 1943 the U.S. Department of the Army contracted the botanist and bioethicist Arthur Galston who discovered the defoliants later used in Agent Orange and his employer University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana to study the effects of 24-D and 245-T on cereal grains (including rice) and broadleaf crops. Galston then a graduate student at the University of Illinois in his research and 1943 Ph.D. dissertation focused on finding a chemical means to make soybeans flower and fruit earlier. He discovered both that 235-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) would speed up the flowering of soybeans and that in higher concentrations it would defoliate the soybeans. From these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply. In early 1945 the U.S. Army ran tests of various 24-D and 245-T mixtures at the Bushnell Army Airfield in Florida. As a result the U.S. began a full-scale production of 24-D and 245-T and would have used it against Japan in 1946 during Operation Downfall if the war had continued.

By the end of the war the relationship between the two countries was well established. In the years after the war the U.S. tested 1100 compounds and field trials of the more promising ones were done at British stations in India and Australia in order to establish their effects in tropical conditions as well as at the U.S.'s testing ground in Florida.

Between 1950 and 1952 trials were conducted in Tanganyika at Kikore and Stunyansa to test arboricides and defoliants under tropical conditions. The chemicals involved were 24-D 245-T and endothall (36-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid). During 1952–53 the unit supervised the aerial spraying of 245-T over the Waturi peninsula in Kenya to assess the value of defoliants in the eradication of tsetse fly.

352,Almost all,Number theory,"In number theory if ''P''(''n'') is a property of positive integers and if ''p''(''N'') denotes the number of positive integers ''n'' less than ''N'' for which ''P''(''n'') holds and if

:''p''(''N'')/''N'' → 1 as ''N'' → ∞

(see limit) then we say that ""''P''(''n'') holds for almost all positive integers ''n''"" (formally asymptotically almost surely).

For example the prime number theorem states that the number of prime numbers less than or equal to ''N'' is asymptotically equal to ''N''/ln ''N''. Therefore the proportion of prime integers is roughly 1/ln ''N'' which tends to 0. Thus ''almost all'' positive integers are composite (not prime) however there are still an infinite number of primes.

278,Automorphism,Definition,"The exact definition of an automorphism depends on the type of ""mathematical object"" in question and what precisely constitutes an ""isomorphism"" of that object. The most general setting in which these words have meaning is an abstract branch of mathematics called category theory. Category theory deals with abstract objects and morphisms between those objects.

In category theory an automorphism is an endomorphism (i.e. a morphism from an object to itself) which is also an isomorphism (in the categorical sense of the word).

This is a very abstract definition since in category theory morphisms aren't necessarily functions and objects aren't necessarily sets. In most concrete settings however the objects will be sets with some additional structure and the morphisms will be functions preserving that structure.

In the context of abstract algebra for example a mathematical object is an algebraic structure such as a group ring or vector space. An isomorphism is simply a bijective homomorphism. (The definition of a homomorphism depends on the type of algebraic structure; see for example group homomorphism ring homomorphism and linear operator).

The identity morphism (identity mapping) is called the '''trivial automorphism''' in some contexts. Respectively other (non-identity) automorphisms are called '''nontrivial automorphisms'''.

917,Actinide,Distribution in nature,"Unprocessed uranium ore

Thorium and uranium are the most abundant actinides in nature with the respective mass concentrations of 1.6% and 4%. Uranium mostly occurs in the Earth's crust as a mixture of its oxides in the minerals uraninite which is also called pitchblende because of its black color. There are several dozens of other uranium minerals such as carnotite (KUO2VO4·3H2O) and autunite (Ca(UO2)2(PO4)2·nH2O). The isotopic composition of natural uranium is 238U (relative abundance 99.2742%) 235U (0.7204%) and 234U (0.0054%); of these 238U has the largest half-life of 4.51 years. The worldwide production of uranium in 2009 amounted to 50572 tonnes of which 27.3% was mined in Kazakhstan. Other important uranium mining countries are Canada (20.1%) Australia (15.7%) Namibia (9.1%) Russia (7.0%) and Niger (6.4%).

 2) thorite (ThSiO4) and monazite ((ThCaCe)PO4). Most thorium minerals contain uranium and vice versa; and they all have significant fraction of lanthanides. Rich deposits of thorium minerals are located in the United States (440000 tonnes) Australia and India (~300000 tonnes each) and Canada (~100000 tonnes).

The abundance of actinium in the Earth's crust is only about 5%. Actinium is mostly present in uranium-containing but also in other minerals though in much smaller quantities. The content of actinium in most natural objects corresponds to the isotopic equilibrium of parent isotope 235U and it is not affected by the weak Ac migration. Protactinium is more abundant (10−12%) in the Earth's crust than actinium. It was discovered in the uranium ore in 1913 by Fajans and Göhring. As actinium the distribution of protactinium follows that of 235U.

The half-life of the longest-lived isotope of neptunium 237Np is negligible compared to the age of the Earth. Thus neptunium is present in nature in negligible amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes. Traces of plutonium in uranium minerals were first found in 1942 and the more systematic results on 239Pu are summarized in the table (no other plutonium isotopes could be detected in those samples). The upper limit of abundance of the longest-living isotope of plutonium 244Pu is 3%. Plutonium could not be detected in samples of lunar soil. Owing to its scarcity in nature most plutonium is produced synthetically.

878,Folklore of the United States,Literature,"Santa Claus also known as Saint Nicholas Father Christmas or simply ""Santa"" is a figure with legendary mythical historical and folkloric origins. The modern figure of Santa Claus was derived from the Dutch figure Sinterklaas which may in turn have its origins in the hagiographical tales concerning the Christian Saint Nicholas. ""A Visit from St. Nicholas"" also known as ""The Night Before Christmas"" is a poem first published anonymously in 1823 and generally attributed to Clement Clarke Moore. The poem which has been called ""arguably the best-known verses ever written by an American"" is largely responsible for the conception of Santa Claus from the mid-nineteenth century to today including his physical appearance the night of his visit his mode of transportation the number and names of his reindeer as well as the tradition that he brings toys to children. The poem has influenced ideas about St. Nicholas and Santa Claus from the United States to the rest of the English-speaking world and beyond. ''Is There a Santa Claus?'' was the title of an editorial appearing in the September 21 1897 edition of The (New York) Sun. The editorial which included the famous reply ""Yes Virginia there is a Santa Claus"" has become a part of popular Christmas folklore in the United States and Canada.

The Headless Horseman is a fictional character from the short story ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" by American author Washington Irving. The story from Irving's collection of short stories entitled The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon has worked itself into known American folklore/legend through literature and film.

The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is a children's novel written by L. Frank Baum and illustrated by W. W. Denslow. Originally published by the George M. Hill Company in Chicago on May 17 1900 it has since been reprinted numerous times most often under the name The Wizard of Oz which is the name of both the 1902 stage play and the well-known adaptation 1939 film version starring Judy Garland. The story chronicles the adventures of a young girl named Dorothy Gale in the Land of Oz after being swept away from her Kansas farm home in a tornado. Thanks in part to the 1939 MGM movie it is one of the best-known stories in American popular culture.

An '''airline''' is a company that provides air transport services for traveling passengers and freight. Airlines utilize aircraft to supply these services and may form partnerships or alliances with other airlines for codeshare agreements. Generally airline companies are recognized with an air operating certificate or license issued by a governmental aviation body.

Airlines vary in size from small domestic airlines to full-service international airlines. Airline services can be categorized as being intercontinental domestic regional or international and may be operated as scheduled services or charters. The largest airline currently is American Airlines Group.

848,African Americans,Introduction,"



'''African Americans''' (also referred to as '''Black Americans''' or '''Afro-Americans''') are an ethnic group of Americans with total or partial ancestry from any of the black racial groups of Africa. The term may also be used to include only those individuals who are descended from enslaved Africans. As a compound adjective the term is usually hyphenated as African-American.

Black and African Americans constitute the third largest racial and ethnic group in the United States (after White Americans and Hispanic and Latino Americans). Most African Americans are descendants of enslaved peoples within the boundaries of the present United States. On average African Americans are of West/Central African and European descent and some also have Native American ancestry.  According to US Census Bureau data African immigrants generally do not self-identify as African American. The overwhelming majority of African immigrants identify instead with their own respective ethnicities (~95%). Immigrants from some Caribbean Central American and South American nations and their descendants may or may not also self-identify with the term.

African-American history starts in the 16th century with peoples from West Africa forcibly taken as slaves to Spanish America and in the 17th century with West African slaves taken to English colonies in North America. After the founding of the United States black people continued to be enslaved with four million denied freedom from bondage prior to the Civil War.  Due largely to notions of white supremacy they were treated as second-class citizens. The Naturalization Act of 1790 limited U.S. citizenship to whites only and only white men of property could vote. These circumstances were changed by Reconstruction development of the black community participation in the great military conflicts of the United States the elimination of racial segregation and the Civil Rights Movement which sought political and social freedom.  In 2008 Barack Obama became the first African American to be elected President of the United States.
